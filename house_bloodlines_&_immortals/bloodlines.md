# Bloodlines
Some individuals grant their progeny some inherited power. Sometimes it is said these individuals were blessed by some god or other, other times the line's sire was an immortal, and others times still there appears to be no divine grace that begins a great bloodline but the power flows through it nonetheless. Bloodlines generally have some physical trait that is passed along with their power but this is not always the case and there are members of bloodlines that do have a common trait who are lacking it. Bloodlines are exclusive, while an individual may have parentage from multiple bloodlines they will only ever exhibit and pass on the powers of a single one.
