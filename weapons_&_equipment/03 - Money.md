## Common Weapons
Weapon prices vary wildly by where the item is purchased, they are much cheaper in larger towns and cities where a blacksmith is likely to have a steady supply of steel and the skill to create arms. Pricing for metal items is listed assuming they're made of steel, bronze weapons are half the price, iron weapons 10% less in cities and 30% less in smaller settlements, crude wooden or stone weapons are sometimes wielded outside of civilized areas but are generally not available for purchase within them. Not all weapons are available in all areas, while knives and arrows can be found just about anywhere many weapons, especially swords, are regional and smaller towns are likely to have much more limited inventory.
