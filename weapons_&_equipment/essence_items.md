# Bound Essence
Most alchemist shops keep a stock of bound essence on hand as it is quick and easy to produce as long as they, or a mage in their employ is capable of casting the desired effects. Most alchemists also keep a menu of effects they can have bound, by another mage they contact out to, upon request.

Some of the most commonly bound effects are:

**name:** effect.

**Healing Potion:** a character consuming such a potion heals 2-6 times faster than usual for next week.
