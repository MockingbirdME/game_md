# Bound Essence
Most alchemist shops keep a stock of bound essence on hand as it is quick and easy to produce as long as they, or a mage in their employ is capable of casting the desired effects. Most alchemists also keep a menu of effects they can have bound, by another mage they contact out to, upon request.

Some of the most commonly bound effects are:

**Augmentation Draughts:** each of these potions grants the drinker 2-6 point bonus to all skill checks based on a specific attribute or the same bonus in meters to the character's base movement speed, these effects can last for as little as two rounds up to a full minute but do not grant any bonus to magical aptitude skill checks.

**Fire Starter:** oil that when poured onto wood ignites it, quality can vary from igniting dry tinder to wet logs.

**Potions of Elemental Resistance:** The drinker of this potion gains 2-6 points of resistance to a single element (heat, cold, or electricity) for between two rounds and one minute.

**Road Wine:** this liquid can be added to drinking water to turn it into passible wine, while not of as high a quality as one could purchase for the same price the light weight nature of this make it very popular amongst travelers - turn 3-5 liters of drinkable water into wine.

**Healing Potion:** a character consuming such a potion heals 2-6 times faster than usual for next week.

**Quick Fix:** This draught or powder restores the user's stamina when consumed or inhaled - the consumer immediately regains 5-25 stamina depending on the skill of the alchemist the user also suffers 25% of the stamina recovered fatigue.

**Safe Water:** these tablets or drops are added to 1-5 liter(s) of water of unknown quality to ensure it is safe to drink.


# Essence Locks
Some common essence locks may be available off the shelf of a high end alchemist shop but most of these items need to be commissioned; most alchemists will keep a catalog of the powers they can imbue and lock into essence. Any alchemist capable of creating essence locks can set a command word or trigger substance as keys to their locks but the more complicated and specific the key the more skilled an alchemist is required to create the lock.
