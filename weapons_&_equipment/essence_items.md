# Bound Essence
Most alchemist shops keep a stock of bound essence on hand as it is quick and easy to produce as long as they, or a mage in their employ is capable of casting the desired effects. Most alchemists also keep a menu of effects they can have bound, by other mages they contact out to, upon request.

Some of the most commonly bound effects are:

**Augmentation Draughts:** each of these potions grants the drinker 2-6 point bonus to all skill checks based on a specific attribute or the same bonus in meters to the character's base movement speed, these effects can last for as little as two rounds up to a full minute but can not grant any bonus to magical aptitude skill checks.

**Dry Water:** this powder can be exposed to air and have its command word spoken to extract 8 ounces of water from the air, this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes depending on climate.

**Fire Starter:** oil that when poured onto wood, or other flammable items, ignites it, quality can vary from igniting dry tinder to wet logs.

**Potions of Elemental Resistance:** The drinker of this potion gains 2-6 points of resistance to a single element (heat, cold, or electricity) for between two rounds and one minute.

**Road Wine:** this liquid can be added to drinking water to turn it into passible wine, while not of the highest quality the lightweight nature of this powder make it very popular amongst travelers - turn 3-5 liters of drinkable water into wine.

**Healing Potion:** a character consuming such a potion heals 2-6 times faster than usual for next week.

**Quick Fix:** This draught or powder restores the user's stamina when consumed or snuffed - the consumer immediately regains 5-25 stamina depending on the skill of the alchemist the user also suffers 25% of the stamina recovered as fatigue.

**Safe Water:** these tablets or drops are added to 1-5 liter(s) of water of unknown quality to ensure it is safe to drink.


# Essence Locks
Some common essence locks may be available off the shelf of a high end alchemist shop but most of these items need to be commissioned; most alchemists will keep a catalog of the powers they can imbue and lock into essence. Any alchemist capable of creating essence locks can set a command word or trigger substance as keys to their locks but the more complicated and specific the key the more skilled an alchemist is needed in order to create the lock.

## Common
**Anti-Ambush Amulet:** these amulets or broaches are designed to trigger the first time a ranged attack would hit the character creating a force barrier with an armor value of 4-6, a body value of 4, and lasting 4-12 rounds. The barrier has it's armor value reduced by two each time it is bypassed and by one for each would the wearer suffers from non-penetrating damage that was reduced by it. The barrier grants added damage reduction equal to its armor value against each attack that bypasses is (this is calculated before the armor value is reduced from penetration). The barrier fails completely if its armor value is reduced to 0. The amulet is destroyed after one use, though more powerful and reusable options are available. 
**Bright Spheres:** these small spheres of class, or occasionally refillable bottles, illuminate the area around them when a command word is said and they are shaken gently. Illuminates between 1 and 4 meters radius in bright light and twice as far in dim, these orbs can be enchanted to last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.



## Specialty
**Laborer's Gloves:** gloves with a few simple runes and a replaceable essence chamber that holds up to 20 successes worth of essence. The gloves can be activated to reduce the weight of any non-living object the character is lifting by half consuming one success per minute they are active.

**Minor's Goggles:** in addition to granting some basic eye protection in the mines these goggles can be activated to reveal the location of all metal within 4-20m of the miner's location for one round, consuming one success of stored essence per 4 meters of range.
