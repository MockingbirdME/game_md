# Arcane Essence
Scholars and philosophers have spent countless hours and spilt much ink discussing what exactly arcane essence is and where it comes from; is it a remnant of Flax's creation, a gift from the Ohma who created life, or the manifestation from arcane energy that was not shaped when it entered the world? What is known is that arcane essence is one of the most sought after substances on Flax, extracted and refined by skilled alchemists, imbued by mages of the highest orders, consumed by those who can afford it, and empowering dependent mages.

## Uses
Not all essence is created equal, the chaff of the refinement process along with essence that was poorly refined by initiate alchemists is generally consumed while higher end essence is imbued with power, storing it to be unleashed at a future time.

## Consuming Essence
Mixed into backed goods or dissolved, or even distilled, in alcohol essence is consumed by members of most strains, providing they can afford it. Essence is acclaimed for its power to take away an individuals weariness, gift healthy, fertility, and longevity.

**Game Effect:** Consuming a dose of essence removes 2 fatigue from the character but inflicts 1d4(rolled in secret by the GM) + 3 fatigue when it wears off; essence wears off 4 hours after its consumption but this time is reset whenever an additional dose is taken. If the total amount of fatigue the essence would inflict when it wears off ever equals or exceeds the character's total stamina they become immune to its benefits for a 1d4 days per dose they took, this effect is known as being essence burnt or essence blind.

An individual who consumes essence regularly will find they suffer withdrawal symptoms if they are not able to consume more on, at least, a daily basis. The symptoms get worse before they get better inflicting general weakness for the first few days that steadily gets worse until the character is fully bedridden then, almost all at once, the effects break and the sufferer find themselves without further symptoms. Sufferers who continue to abstain from essence may periodically have a relapse of these symptoms but for only a few days not the weeks or months of the original withdrawal.

**Game Effect:** a character who consumes essence regularly (GM's determination) and is unable to take at least once dose per day for a number of days equal to their body stat -1d4 will begin suffering withdrawal. Each stage of withdrawal lasts 1d10 days and causes the character to suffer penalty dice to all actions equal to the stage they are in, once the character's stage has progressed to the point where they are suffering at least as many penalty dice as their body attribute change the number of days each stage lasts to 1d4, if the stage lasts only one day the symptoms stop getting worse and penalty dice are removed at a rate of one per 6 hours of rest; if the character ever has twice as many penalty dice as their body stat and the stage lasts for four days they will die on the final day.

Some individuals have arcane potential that they find unlocked by the consumption of essence, these dependent mages regularly consume essence to maintain their power.

**Game Effect:** character's with the dependent mage trait may store a number of doses of essence within themselves equal to their body stat, they still gain the benefits described above as well as the penalties for when those benefits wear off but loose only one stored dose per day unless spent to reduce arcane dues. A dependent mage suffers three penalty dice to all arcane skill checks if they have no doses of essence stored within them.

## Sources
Most essence is harvested from the Shardlands where it can be found in veins of rock and sand just as iron can be in Askelon or zinc in Proto. The corpses of Mablen as well as both bodies and eggs of Pure-Blooded Torlini and their Dragon kin are also known to be sources of very high end essence though their extraction requires a skill alchemist. All essence requires refinement, a delicate and time consuming process performed by alchemists.
