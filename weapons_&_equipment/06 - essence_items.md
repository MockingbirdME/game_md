# Essence Items
## Alchemists and Artificers
There are two basic classes of people that create magical items. Alchemists are not necessarily mages but have studied arcane essence and are able to prepare it in such a way as to mimic the imbue essence arcane power, Artificers are mages with access to the sense magic, suppress magic, imbue essence, duration true, and arcane targeting arcane powers as well as extensive training in crafting runes. While Alchemy can effectively be done quickly by a mage with the imbue essence arcane power but essence bound in such a way rarely lasts as long as those bound by a trained alchemist and extracts a price in arcane dues that the alchemist need not pay; artificery, on the other hand, always requires magic be used when crafting runes and as such can take a toll on the artificer.

## Bound Essence
Most alchemist shops keep a stock of bound essence on hand as it is quick and easy to produce as long as they, or a mage in their employ is capable of casting the desired effects. Most alchemists also keep a menu of effects they can have bound, by other mages they contact out to, upon request.

Some of the most commonly bound effects are:

#### Anti-Ambush (Traveler's) Amulet
 these amulets or broaches are designed to trigger the first time a ranged attack would hit the character creating a force barrier with an armor value of 4-6, a body value of 4, and lasting 4-12 rounds. The barrier has its armor value reduced by two each time it is bypassed and by one for each wound the wearer suffers from non-penetrating damage. The barrier grants added damage reduction equal to its armor value against each attack that bypasses is (this is calculated before the armor value is reduced from penetration). The barrier fails completely if its armor value is reduced to 0. The amulet is destroyed after one use, though more powerful and reusable options are available.

#### Augmentation Draughts
 each of these potions grants the drinker 2-6 point bonus to all skill checks based on a specific attribute or the same bonus in meters to the character's base movement speed, these effects can last for as little as two rounds up to a full minute but can not grant any bonus to magical aptitude skill checks.

#### Bright Spheres
 these small spheres of glass, or occasionally refillable bottles, illuminate the area around them when a command word is said and they are shaken gently. Illuminates between 1 and 4 meters radius in bright light and twice as far in dim, these orbs can be enchanted to last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.

#### Dry Water
 this powder can be exposed to air and have its command word spoken to extract 8 ounces of water from the air, this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes depending on climate.

#### Fire Starter
 oil that when poured onto wood, or other flammable items, ignites it, quality can vary from igniting dry tinder to wet logs.

#### Potions of Elemental Resistance
 The drinker of this potion gains 2-6 points of resistance to a single element (heat, cold, or electricity) for between two rounds and one minute.

#### Road Wine
 this liquid can be added to drinking water to turn it into passible wine, while not of the highest quality the lightweight nature of this powder make it very popular amongst travelers - turn 3-5 liters of drinkable water into wine.

#### Healing Potion
 a character consuming such a potion heals much faster than usual for next week. Each healing roll they make gains 1-4 bonus dice and if they would recover at least one wound they recover the same number additional wounds.

#### Quick Fix
 This draught or powder restores the user's stamina when consumed or snuffed - the consumer immediately regains 5-25 stamina depending on the skill of the alchemist the user also suffers 25% of the stamina recovered as fatigue.

#### Safe Water
 these tablets or drops are added to 1-5 liter(s) of water of unknown quality to ensure it is safe to drink.


## Essence Locks
A skilled alchemist can tie their bound essence to an essence lock; a simple artifact that consists of little more than an activation run, and sometimes a linking rune though often their designed to touch the essence they're triggering directly. Using a lock makes the bound effect much more secure to tampering by other alchemists or mages trained to manipulate raw arcane power, it also adds a level of complexity that makes binding essence in such a way more difficult, time consuming, and ultimately more expensive to the item's purchaser.


## Artifacts
The most skilled alchemists and artificers can harness true essence into permanent enchantments by etching it into runes on an item thereby creating an artifact. These runes used together provide access to one or more spell signatures that can in turn be cast provided enough non-depleted essence is available to power them.

Runes are not standard for all artificers; there is no one way, or even one best way, to etch a rune. though most schools do attempt some level of standardization. For each artificer the runes they etch are a physical manifestation of the power imbued in them as the artificer understands it, about the only consistency is that more powerful runes are more intricate and more difficult to get right. Even as runes can be personal to an individual artificers they still need to be perfect to work, a slip of the hand or misjudged angle can lead to an entire artifact being rendered useless and much of the true essence that went into its construction lost.


### Artifacts vs Bound Essence
Artifacts have a number of advantages over bound essence.
* The power of artifacts does not expire.
* Artifacts are powered by raw essence and do not requiring arcane work to charge after first created.
* The power of an artifact is always locked and can not be released by an enemy mage.
* Each rune of an artifact can be etched and imbued separately so no one mage needs to be able to supply of of the power.

All the advantages are however often outweighed by the cost of creating them. Bound essence requires only an alchemist and a mage, often the same person, and some refined essence while even the simplest artifacts require an artificer, an alchemist, a mage, and true essence. The additional skill requirements and use of true essence over refined essence increases the cost greatly.

### Parts of an Artifact
Artifacts consist of pretty standard components, though many of these can be highly specialized.

#### Activation Runes
 The simplest artifacts, keys, are nothing but an activation rune. The activation runes on an artifact is a single  rune that holds details about the specific spell(s)/effects(s) it can trigger. The trigger condition can be anything from a command word to physically pressing the run or even read the wielder's mind to determine when to active. These spells/effects come from either bound essence locked by the activation runes or from other runes on the artifact that the key is designed to activate. Some complex activation runes are actually two or more that work in concert to activate some combination of runes depending on how they are activated.

#### Power Runes
 The most complicated and specialized runes, and the one's most likely to be referenced when the type of rune being discussed is not specified, power runes each hold the ability to mimic an arcane power. Multiple power runes can be linked, via XXX, to each other and an activator to create a wide range of effects in a very similar manner to a mage combining multiple powers to cast a spell. Multiple effects from a single arcane theme can be combined into especially versatile power runes but crafting these is far more difficult and expensive than simply using a number of simpler runes to provide the same powers.

#### Linking Runes
 Sometimes called pairing runes, these very simple runes connect other runes to one another and to the artifact's power source, without these runes none of the others can work together. Most conduits connect two or more specific other runes but some, more complicated, ones can be used connect generic runes allowing for modular artifacts.

#### Targeting Runes
 These runes direct the output of power, without them the effect(s) trigger in the immediate area of the activation rune with no specific target.

#### Reserves
 The source that powers the artifact's triggered effects. Many artifacts have a single internal store of true essence that recharges itself while others utilize batteries, replaceable essence storage containers, or reservoirs, refillable essence storage containers, that are drained by the artifact's use.

### Common


#### TBD
 consisting of two wrist bands that allow two characters to communicate to each other at a whisper provided they're within 150 meters of one another. The wrist bands loose their potency after an hour of total use.

#### Laborer's Gloves
 gloves with a few simple runes and a replaceable essence chamber that holds up to 20 successes worth of essence. The gloves can be activated to reduce the weight of any non-living object the character is lifting by half consuming one success per minute they are active.

#### Minor's Goggles
 in addition to granting some basic eye protection in the mines these goggles can be activated to reveal the location of all metal within 4-20m of the miner's location for one round, consuming one success of stored essence per 4 meters of range.
