* Two-handed - when wielding a weapon with the _Two-handed_ trait two-handed count the character’s body stat as 2 greater than it is, when wielding it one handed add a penalty die to the attack.

## Bows
All bows have a body statistic much like a character does, many of the bow's stats are derived from this body stat. Bows stats are as follows:
* Close Range: body
* Range Increment: 3 x body
* Max Range: 12 x body
* Range Penalty: 1 die and 1 APV
* Damage Type: based on arrow type
* Damage: ¾ body plus die based on arrow type
* APV: ½ body modified by arrow type
* Additional Successes: one APV per success or d4 damage per two successes
* Notes: bows require two hands to use, if a character’s body stat plus ranks in the bows secondary skill does not equal or exceed the bow’s body rating they suffer one penalty die for each point they are short, bows can not be used with the aim action.
* Reload: notching a readied arrow to a readied bow costs no stamina and has no turn requirement.

### Arrows
Bows require arrows in order to be worth much. Arrows determine the damage type of the attack and grant a APV and Damage modification to the bow's attack, this modification is some dice that are added to the APV and Damage on an a per attack basis.

### Example Bows
* Hunter’s Bow - Body: 7, Close Range: 7m, Range Increment: 21m, Max Range: 84m, Range Penalty: 1 die and 1 APV, Damage Type: based on arrow type, Damage: 5 + arrow die, APV: 4 modified by arrow type.

* Max Range: 3 x body + 50m
* Range Penalty: 1 die 1 damage and 1 APVsed on arrow type
* Damage: ½ body plus die based on arrow type

* Additional Successes: one damage
* Notes: crossbows require two hands to use, the turn requirement of a reload action cannot be reduced, a character can not move in the same turn they reload a crossbow.

### Bolts
Crossbows require bolts as bows require arrows. Bolts determine the damage type of the attack and grant a APV and Damage modification to the crossbow's attack, this modification is some dice that are added to the APV and Damage on an a per attack basis.

### Reloading crossbows
there are a few different ways to reload a crossbow based on the actions below. All actions to reload a crossbow cost 0 stamina. Any reload action that has a turn requirement of greater than one must have the reload performed over subsequent turns or they must start over. A character can not take a move action on the same turn they take a reload action.
* Hand loading: crossbows with body less than or equal to twice the character’s, one turn requirement. If the crossbow’s body is less than the character’s they may still take a move action this turn.
* Goats foot Loading: crossbows with body less than or equal to the three times the character’s, two turn requirement. Requires a goats foot loading device.
* Windlass Loading: any crossbow, requires a windlass loading device, not all actions required to complete this loading must be taken on subsequent turns. Turn requirement of one for each 4 body the crossbow has (body 5-8 = 2 rounds, 9-12 = 3, 13-16 = 4 etc.).
