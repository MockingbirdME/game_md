# Galterainian Essence Arms
The artificers of Galt are second to none, they were the first to create essence locks and keys and the first to discover true essence. These technologies have been used to create numerous weapons and armors that are marketed to those wealthy enough to commission them.

### Galterainian Pistols
Force mages have been using small stones as projectiles since the creation of the strains, and for centuries mages have known that projecting bullets through tubes or pipes has aided the accuracy of these projectiles. The, now deceased, Arch-Mechanic of the Galterainian Artificers Guild, "Black" Maelin took this simple practice and created bound essence packets containing a simple projection spell that was unlocked by a touch key, he then attached the key to a bronze pipe and created a simple trigger mechanism to touch the key to an inserted essence packet; by placing in the base of the pipe first a wad of cotton to keep things from falling out then a bronze bullet cast to fit snuggly in the pipe and finally one of his bound essence packets before securing the end he had a portable short ranged weapon that could be fired off at a moments notice with just a pull of the trigger that touched the key to the packet, this was the first Galterainian pistol.

Since their invention pistols have come a long way, essence packets are often pre-packed with cotton and a bullet for quick loading of the weapon and many pistols have multiple barrels that fire at once or multiple chambers in a rotating cylinder that can be loaded individually and fired one at a time until all packets have been spent.  

**Standard Pistols:** have a key that can be used to trigger specific essence locks, the key is generally simple to change out. The pistol accepts a metal or clay bullet and a essence packet. The close range and range increment of the projection effect stored in the packet are increased by 25% thanks to the pistol barrel accuracy increasing effects. Pistols hare a difficulty of 3.

**Long Arm Pistols:** most pistols are used for close range combat as bows and crossbows are generally more effective at long range and are much cheaper but longer pistols, both one and two handed, do exist increasing the close range and range increment of the essence by between 50% and 200% depending on the size of the weapon. These generally use essence packets with stronger projection spells that provide a increased maximum range as well.

**Multi Barrel Pistols:** pistols with multiple barrels and keys allow the user to either fire multiple bullets at once or fire each barrel individually. These pistols work best with all barrels using the same caliber of essence packet. When firing multiple barrels at once make a single attack skill check and resolve the effects of each bullet individually, extra successes must be applied the same for each bullet. These pistols exist in two, three, and four barrel configurations.

**Multi Chamber Pistols:** pistols with a single barrel but multiple chambers allow for multiple shots without most of the added bulk of a multi barrel pistol. These pistols have mostly replaced multi barrel pistols as they are cheaper, lighter, and require only one key. Multi chamber pistols generally contain two or three chambers; 4 to eight chamber pistols do exist but require either a much larger cylinder or smaller essence packets, the latter requires the packets be made of higher quality essence making the packets much more expensive.
