## Mounts and Draft Animals
**Donkeys:** The most common domestic work animal all across the continent used for both riding and labor. 
**Horses:** Horses first appeared on Flax with the Centari people in the last years before the fall of Grail. They are far faster than the common Flaxian donkey and are highly prized by the Centari and any able to afford purchasing one from them. Horses seem to only breed with one another at the direction of a Centari master and thus are quite rare outside of the Centari lands.
**Mules:** While horses seem incapable of breeding with each other without Cenatri direction they have no such reluctance to intermingling with Flaxean donkeys, these sterile offspring are generally considered stronger than horses of the same size, more patient than horses, easier to train than donkeys and longer lived than either. They have become quite popular everywhere they are available.
**Ostriches:** Popular in the southern half of Flax ostriches are to small to carry many of the larger strains for long but they make excellent mounts for Denja and Teejee and are usually used to pull carts, wagons, and chariots; they can also be trained to participate in combat on their own alongside a handler and are used for food.
**Elk:** These massive northern mounts are used by the Rhosk for travel and warfare, rare outside of the northern reaches elk are difficult to breed in large quantities and take much more work to train than most other mounts.
**Oxen:** Larger carts and wagons are sometimes pulled by oxen but they are mostly used on farms as donkeys or mules are generally better at most jobs.
**Tor'XXXXX:**
**Teejee Drones:**
