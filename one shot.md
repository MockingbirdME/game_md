Basic Story Intro - lives on a small island off the coast of eastern marshes, population is only a few thousand. Island officially controlled by Galabrain but is remote enough it has little contact with the outside world. The fishing and farming economy keeps the people fed but the violent seas make regular travel to the main land dangerous.

The characters live in the small town of Kelsp. Kelsp is ruled by the Orso Clan (sapeen) who is in a three generation long blood feud with Clan Pelto (sapeen) who lord over neighboring Relnt.

The population is a mix of sapeen, denja, teejee (all controlled as the island has but one queen), and very few Rhosk.

The players should be allied with the Orso Clan and loyal to it's leader Lady Lynn.

The story starts with the characters weathering a storm in the town's great hall. An assassin places a knife in Thissel, one of Lynn's lieutenants and makes a run for it.
