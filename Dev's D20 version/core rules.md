# Skill Checks
When a character may wishes to attempt an action where success is not certain and failure is not guaranteed, or when a characterâ€™s degree of success or failure matters, the GM may call for a skill check.

## Making a Skill Check
To perform a skill check requires a number of steps as follows:
1. Determine relevant attribute and skill.
2. Determine difficulty and required successes.
2. Determine (dis)advantage - a character gains disadvantage if they are not proficient in the relevant skill, gains advantage for each rank of proficiency beyond the first and may gain any number of either from situational benefits. If a character has both advantage and disadvantage they remove one of each until only one or the other is being added to the skill check.
3. Roll 2d10 + 1d10 for every level of (dis)advantage in the skill check.
4. Select two dice from the roll, the lowest two if the roll has disadvantage otherwise the highest two.
5. Add the character's relevant attribute's bonus/penalty to the sum of the two dice selected from the previous step.
6. Compare the total from step five to the difficulty of the skill check and determine results.

## Difficulties:
* 6-7 - very easy
* 8-10 - easy
* 11-12 - standard difficulty for most actions.
* 13-15 - difficult
* 16-17 - very difficult
* 18+ - Extremely difficult

## Skill Check Results
* Less than 5 - critical failure, not only does the action fail but something went wrong as determined by the GM.
* Less than difficulty - failure, the action simply fails but nothing else goes wrong.
* Equal to difficulty -  near success, the action was not a complete success but brought the character closer to success than they were before performing the action.
* Equal to difficulty plus required successes - complete success, the action is successful.
* Greater than difficulty plus required successes - the action gains an additional success for each point by which the result exceeds the difficulty.

### Melee Actions
Unless stated otherwise in the action description taking a melee action adds one level of disadvantage to all other skill checks the character makes this turn.
#### Basic Attack
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 0
Make a brawling attack or an attack with a readied melee weapon. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results.
#### Bash
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
**Requires:** Weapon/attack with the *Bash* keyword that deals concussive damage.
Make an attack with a readied melee weapon. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check gains a level of disadvantage if the character does not have at least one rank in the *bash secondary skill (melee combat)*. If the attack hits the target back one hex, and the first X additional successes must be spent to knock the target prone where X is equal to one plus the target's *size*, if positive, plus the targets *body* and minus the attacker's rank in the *bash secondary skill (melee combat)*. If the character succeeds in knocking their target back one hex they may advance one hex as part of this action.
#### Bull Rush
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
**Requires:** *body* of at least +1.
Make a brawling attack or attack with an equipped shield attempting to push the target back. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check uses *body* instead of *reflexes* as the primary attribute, gains one level of disadvantage if the character does not have at least one rank in the *bull rush secondary skill (melee combat)* and the target's *melee defense bonus* does not benefit from any shield(s) they may be wielding. On a hit the target is pushed back one hex per rank the character has in the bull rush secondary skill (melee combat), and unless the target is pinned against a wall or other hard surface the first X additional successes must be spent to increase the distance the target is pushed by one hex where X is equal to the sum of the target's *body* and *size* (minimum one) after the first X successes have been spent each additional success increases the distance pushed by one hex; if the target is pushed into a wall or other hard surface increase the damage inflicted by the attack by the number of hexes the target was pushed and any remaining successes can be spent to increase the damage by two. The attacker moves with the target as they are pushed but may choose to stop a number of hexes, equal to their *body* attribute, short; doing so prevents them from using additional successes for extra damage.
#### Disarm
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
Make a brawling attack or an attack with a readied melee weapon with the aim to disarm the target rather than harm them. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check gains a level of disadvantage if the character doesn't have at least one rank in the *disarm secondary skill (melee combat)*, an additional level of disadvantage if the character is unarmed unless they have at least two ranks in the *disarm secondary skill (melee combat)*, and an additional level of disadvantage if the target is wielding their weapon in two hands. If the attack was performed unarmed and the skill check failed the attacker suffers the effects of being hit by the weapon they were attempting to disarm as if the attacker had a *body* of 0. If the skill check succeeds instead of inflicting damage the target's weapon (attacker's choice if wielding more than one) is knocked to the ground at their feet, each additional success may be used to knock the disarmed weapon an additional hex away from the target and 5 minus the character's rank in the *disarm secondary skill (melee combat)* additional successes may be spent to allow a character in the same hex as the weapon to ready it provided they have a free hand.
#### Distracting Attack
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
**Requires:** at least one rank in the *distracting attack secondary skill (melee combat)*.
Make a brawling attack or an attack with a readied melee weapon designed to distract the target more than harm them. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check has two levels of disadvantage added to it, reduced by the character's rank in the *distracting attack secondary skill (melee combat)*. On a near success or greater result for the skill check reduce the target's defense by an additional amount equal to the character's rank in the *distracting attack secondary skill (melee combat)*, then ignore any additional successes.
#### Flurry of Blows
**Action Points:** 2
**Stamina Cost:** 3
Make a brawling attack or an attack with a readied melee weapon. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. The skill check gains one level of advantage. Ignore any additional successes to the skill check but resolve the effects of the attack one plus the character's rank in the *flurry of blows secondary skill (melee combat)* times.
#### Off-Hand Attack
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 0
Make a brawling attack or an attack with a readied melee weapon with the *small* keyword in the character's off-hand. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. This skill check gains one level of disadvantage unless the character has at least one rank in the *off-hand attack secondary skill (melee combat)*, this is in addition to the penalty die gained for performing an attack with the character's off-hand. Ignore any additional successes on this skill check in excess of the character's rank in the *off-hand attack secondary skill (melee combat)*. If the character has taken a different melee action already turn, the first time they take this action they may ignore all levels of disadvantage generated for having already taken melee actions this turn.
#### Power Attack
**Action Points:** 1
**Stamina Cost:** 1
Make a brawling attack or an attack with a readied melee weapon. The character makes a *melee attack skill check* and applies the results. This skill check has one level of disadvantage added to it if the character does not have at least one rank in the *power attack secondary skill (melee combat)*. If the attack hits it deals one plus the character's rank in the *power attack secondary skill (melee combat)* extra damage, double the extra damage if the character already performed a dash action this turn.

#### Free attack
When an opponent provokes a free attack the character may make a basic attack action, off handed attack action, loose/shoot/fire action, or a throw action with a ready, loaded when applicable, weapon or spell against that opponent. This reaction's stamina cost is that of the action taken.
