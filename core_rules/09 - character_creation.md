# Creating a character

## Simple Steps:
Creating characters can be done in a few simple steps. Before any number crunching or stat optimization is performed it is recommended that the GM and players discuss the game they plan on playing and work together to make characters that, as a group, will be likely to succeed and fun to play. It can also be good to put together a backstory for the character either before or shortly after creation.
1. Determine power level of character being created. First time players are recommended to start with characters at power level 0 or 1; this will give each character a good variety of skills to use during play with lots of room for character development as they advance through the story.
1. Choose a strain from those the GM is allowing, it's recommended that players be limited to the primary strains for most games with potential further limiting based on the story the GM is looking to tell.
1. Assign attributes - each strain has a list of starting values for the four primary attributes as well as a number of attribute points that can be spent to improve these starting values. Each attribute can be increased up to two times at a cost of one attribute point each, and can be increased one additional time at a cost of two attribute points.
1. Starting Languages - the GM, working with the players and story, will grant each character one or more language traits. These traits should make sense for the character's strain and backstory and all character's should share at least one common language.
1. Pick traits - like attributes points all character’s will have a number of trait points granted by their strain, and increased by the character’s power level. These can be spent to purchase general, arcane, or strain specific traits. If the GM is allowing negative traits these may be taken but rather than costing trait points they provide their value in additional trait points; a GM allowing negative traits for player characters may choose to limit the maximum number of trait points gained from them.
1. Assign skills - each power level of character being created provides a skill array. Each number in the array can be assigned to one primary skill granting that many ranks in the base skill.
1. Secondary skills - for primary skills at rank one or higher gain one rank in an associated secondary skill unless the character possesses a trait that over rules this for a given skill (such as the arcane traits).
1. Skills from traits - most character’s will have spent some trait points on the skilled trait. For each trait point spent in skilled the character gains one skill point that can be spent. One plus the new rank can be spent to gain one rank in a secondary skill providing doing so does not conflict with other rules, such as those from an arcane trait. Alternately a number of skill points equal three times its new rank may be spent to increase increase a primary skills rank by one, gaining a rank in a secondary skill in the process if this is the first rank in that base skill.
1. Gear and spells - work with the GM to determine what gear the character may begin the game in possession of. Characters with arcane traits also will create a spell list and check it with the GM.
1. The character starts the game with 5 plus their starting power level advancement points.

## Power Levels:
Each power level listed is designed to showcase different levels of adventurer; they list additional attribute and trait points the character gets as well as a list of primary skill ranks to be assigned during step six of character creation.
