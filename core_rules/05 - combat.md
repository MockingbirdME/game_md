## Combat and round based play
Sometimes characters find themselves in stressful, potentially life or death, situations where the timing of each action becomes more important; at these times the game transitions from the normal player/GM narrative into round based play. In round based play characters declare and resolve their actions on their turns which happen in initiative order. Once all characters have acted the GM describes the updated scene; if the reason for round based play continues to be present recheck everyones initiative and begin another round.

### Turns during round based combat
Each character on their turn may take actions to move, attack, etc. All actions they may take have a cost in stamina, defense, or both as well as a turn requirement; a character may not declare multiple actions with a turn requirement of one or greater during their turn. An action’s turn requirement is simply how many turns a character must take in order to perform that action, an action with a standard turn requirement of zero may only be taken once per turn unless detailed otherwise in the actions description.

## Combat Actions
These actions actions are those that will commonly be taken during round based combat but are by no means limited to that type of play. Each action is detailed with its name followed by its stamina cost in parentheses and a description.

### Move actions
Character's move during combat they have a number of different options when doing so and may select one, or more, of them each round as detailed below. If a character makes any non movement actions during their turn they may take them during any point in their movement (ie. a character who walks 4m may move two take another action then move the other two).
#### Walk(0)
Move half your base movement in meters, round down. This action has its turn requirement reduced to zero if it's the first move action the character takes during their turn\.
#### Dash(1)
Move up to your base movement in meters. This action has its turn requirement reduced to zero if it's the first move action the character takes during their turn\.
#### Sprint(3)
The character makes a sprint skill check and resolves its effects.
#### Swim(2)
Make a skill check using body as the primary attribute, personal movement as the primary skill, and a difficulty of 10-30(depending on conditions), if the check succeeds move through water up to 1 meter per rank in the swim secondary skill plus 1 meter per additional success in the skill check. This action has its turn requirement reduced to zero if it's the first move action the character takes during their turn\.
#### Climb(2)
Make a skill check using body as the primary attribute, personal movement as the primary skill, and a difficulty of 10-30(depending on conditions), on a success transverse across a surface up to 1 meter per rank in the climb secondary skill plus 1 meter per success in the skill check, if the skill check critically fails the character loses his grip and falls. This action has its turn requirement reduced to zero if it's the first move action the character takes during their turn\.
#### Jump(2)
 make a skill check using body as the primary attribute, personal movement as the primary skill, and a difficulty of 10, on a success jump horizontally a number or meters equal to your rank in the jump secondary skill plus 1 meter per two additional success, or half that distance vertically, increase the total distance by 50% if you've taken a dash or sprint action already this turn.

#### Bash(2)

The attack’s skill check gains two penalty dice unless it is being performed with a shield. If the attack hits, in addition to the normal effects, compare its damage plus twice the character's rank in the bash secondary skill, to the target’s defense, if the damage fails to exceed the target’s melee defense but is greater than their defense the target must move back one meter, if the damage exceeds the target’s melee defense they are knocked to their knees, if it exceeds it by 5 or more the target is knocked prone.
#### Bull Rush(2)
Make a melee attack skill check using the character's body as their weapon, substituting their body attribute for reflexes as the primary attribute for this skill check, and ignoring any shield bonuses to the target's defense. On a success the character pushes the target back one meter and deals concussive damage equal to their body stat, additional successes may be spent to increase this distance by one meter per success. If the movement pushes the defender against a wall or other hard surface increase the damage this attack deals by 3 and gain the ability to spend additional successes to increase the damage by 1 each.

If the skill check succeeds, instead of the normal effects, the weapon is knocked to the ground, for each additional success on this attack the weapon may be moved one meter in a direction of the attacker's choice. If this attack is made with the attacker's body and fails the attacker suffers damage as if they were struck by the weapon they attempted to disarm, this damage is reduced by the character's rank in the disarm secondary skill, otherwise if the skill check succeed with at least one additional success the attacker may ready the disarmed weapon.

#### Lunge(2)
Make a melee attack skill check treating the character’s, not the weapon’s, reach as double its standard value for this attack plus the character's rank in the lunge secondary skill.

Limit once per round.
#### Power attack(2)
Make a melee attack skill check with two penalty dice added to it, zero penalty dice if this is the first attack after the character performed a dash action this turn; the character treats his body stat as if it were the character's rank in the power attack secondary skill greater for the purposes of calculating damage on this attack.

#### Quick attack(2)
Make a melee attack skill check with a turn requirement of 0, if the skill check succeeds the character ignores any additional successes in excess of their rank in the quick attack secondary skill.
