## Combat and round based play
Sometimes characters find themselves in stressful, potentially life or death, situations where the timing of each action becomes more important; at these times the game transitions from the normal player/GM narrative into round based play. In round based play characters declare and resolve their actions on their turns which happen in initiative order. Once all characters have acted the GM describes the updated scene; if the reason for round based play continues to be present recheck everyones initiative and begin another round.

### Turns during round based combat
Each character on their turn may take actions to move, attack, etc. All actions they may take have a cost in stamina, defense, or both as well as a turn requirement; a character may not declare multiple actions with a turn requirement of one or greater during their turn. An action’s turn requirement is simply how many turns a character must take in order to perform that action, an action with a standard turn requirement of zero may only be taken once per turn unless detailed otherwise in the actions description.

## Combat Actions
These actions actions are those that will commonly be taken during round based combat but are by no means limited to that type of play. Each action is detailed with its name followed by its stamina cost in parentheses and a description.

### Move actions
The first move action a character takes each round has a turn requirement of zero, subsequent move actions have a turn requirement of one. When outside of turn based combat there is no need to specifically track stamina spent on movement, if moving at a regular pace (up to five times your base movement per minute) arrive at your destination with full stamina if moving at a quick pace (up to 10 times your base movement per minute) you arrive at any destination with only half your max stamina and suffer two penalty dice to all perception checks along the way.
