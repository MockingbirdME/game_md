## Arcane Traits:
Any character may study magic but only those few who possess an arcane trait can shape and wield it. Arcane traits allow the character to craft magical effects and cast spells. A character may take only those arcane traits allowed by their strain, at the cost listed in the strain’s description.
* **Dependent Mage** - dependent mages have less arcane potential than other magic users and are unable to shape magic without consuming the alchemical substance, commonly known as, arcane essence. Dependent mages may not learn arcane theme secondary skills. Dependent mages may not spend skill or advancement points to gain new or increased ranks in arcane aptitude secondary skills but when they increase their rank in arcane aptitude they gain a number of bonus secondary skill ranks equal to their new rank in the base skill. Dependent mages may absorb more arcane essence than other characters; their bodies may absorb and store up to a number of doses equal to their body stat. A dependent mage may burn 1 dose of arcane essence in their system to reduce the effects of arcane dues by 1 wound, 3 fatigue, or 9 stamina; if the dose spent was the final dose in the mages system they suffer the normal effects of essence wearing off.
* **Learned Mage** - these mages have spent years studying, training, and enduring all manner of physical and mental trials in order to unlock their arcane potential. A learned mage must spend twice as many skill or advancement points to increase their rank in any arcane aptitude secondary skill. They may learn any arcane theme secondary skill that they have a teacher for and meet the theme's requirements.
* **Natural Mage** - natural mages do not require training or arcane essence in order to unlock their magical talents; the power is in the mage’s blood and is as natural to them as language or movement. Natural mages select a single arcane theme secondary skill when they take their first p**oint in arcane aptitude, the mage must use their free secondary skill rank gained for their first rank in the base skill on this arcane theme. Natural mages may spend build or advancement points to learn magical effect secondary skills but may never increase their rank beyond 1. Natural mages when determining arcane dues increase their body score by an amount equal to their rank in arcane aptitude when casting spells. A character may take this trait additional times in order to gain a second, or third etc., arcane theme secondary skill; if done the second arcane theme will gain its first rank when arcane aptitude increases to rank 2, a third theme would gain its first rank when arcane aptitude is increased to rank three, etc.; each arcane theme that the character has at least 1 rank in will gain a rank each time the base skill is leveled up thereafter. Strains that have access to this will have 2 costs listed, the first is the cost of the first time this trait is taken and the second is the price for gaining additional arcane themes.

## Negative Traits:
Like general traits negative traits are available to any character, with GM approval. These traits bestow some penalty onto the character.
