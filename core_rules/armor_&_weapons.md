# Armor & Weapons

### Armor:
Characters expecting combat tend to make sure they are as well protected as they can afford to be.

##### Armor Statistics:
Values that detail how the armor protects its wearer.
* Armor value: used to determine if penetrating damage is blocked and becomes concussive.
* Body value: added to the character’s body stat when determining how much damage is taken from a blow.
* Reflex value: a number of penalty dice reduced by the sum of the character’s rank in personal defense and the armor secondary skill added to all reflex based skill checks performed with the penalized body location.
* Damage reduction: types and amount by which damage the character would suffer is reduced.
* Body locations: locations covered by the armor.

##### Layered armor:
When a character is wearing layers armor they gain benefits from each layer as follows:
* Armor value - the sum of the value of the piece of armor with the highest armor value, half the value, rounded down, of the of piece with the second highest value, plus one for each additional piece with an armor value.
* Body value - the sum of the value of the piece of armor with the highest value plus half the value, rounded down, of each other piece.
* Reflex value - the sum of the values of each piece of armor plus one for each piece beyond the first.
* Damage reduction - the sum of the specific damage resistance of each piece of armor.

### Weapons:
Weapons come in two basic types, melee and ranged, with some throwing weapons have statistics for both.

##### Melee weapon passive statistics:
Used when calculating the weapon’s defensive values or stats that don’t change based weapon use.
* Reach: the default reach of the weapon.
* Parry bonus: listed in two parts, one/two handed and off handed, add this bonus to the character’s melee defense when wielding the weapon in these ways. A character’s total parry bonus can not exceed the sum of their ranks in personal defense, the parry secondary skill, and the weapon’s secondary skill. Reduce this bonus by one for each penalty die the character would gain due to the weapon’s difficulty.
* Cover bonus: a defensive bonus that only applies to attacks originating in the character’s front arc.
* Difficulty: attack skill checks made with the weapon receive this many penalty dice reduced by the sum of the character’s ranks in melee combat and the weapon’s secondary skill.
* Secondary skill: the specific secondary skill(s) related to the use of this weapon.
* Notes: any additional information needed for the proper use of the weapon.

##### Attack statistics:
Melee weapon attacks have a reach stat while ranged attacks have a series of range statistics.
* Reach: the reach of the attack.
* Range, close: the maximum range this weapon can attack without suffering range penalties.
* Range, increment: when attacking beyond close range divide the attack’s distance by the ranged increment, round up, and apply the weapon’s range penalty that many times to the attack’s skill check.
* Range, max: the furthest this weapon can be used at.
* Range, penalty: the penalty applied to the attack’s skill check and/or damage by each range increment.
* Damage type: the type of damage the attack inflicts.
* Damage: how much damage the attack inflicts.
* Armor piercing value(APV): compared to an opponent’s armor value when making an attack to see if it is able to inflict penetrating damage on a hit.
* Additional Successes: the bonus the weapon gains for each additional success on the attack skill check not spent on another effect. If the weapon gives armor piercing value or damage it gains armor piercing value until it successfully bypasses the target’s armor after which it gains damage instead.
* Secondary Skill: The secondary skill relevant to the weapon for this attack.
* Notes: additional information for to this attack type.
