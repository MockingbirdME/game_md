# Actions

### The skill check:
Many times in a game a character may wish to attempt an action where success is not certain failure is not guaranteed, or there may be times where a character’s degree of success or failure matters; in these situations the GM may call for a skill check.

##### Important terms for a skill check:
* Primary attribute - the primary attribute most relevant to the action being taken.
* Primary skill - the base skill most relevant to the action being taken.
* Relevant secondary skills - the one, or more, secondary skills used in the action.
* Die pool - dice rolled when making a skill check.
* Bonus Dice - extra d6s added to the skill check.
* Penalty Dice - a penalty die is a d6 added to the skill check that after the dice are rolled removes the die with the highest result from the die pool.

##### Steps for making a skill check:
* Declare the action the character intends to take
* Determine if action requires a skill check
* Determine primary attribute, primary skill, and relevant secondary skill(s)
* Build die pool
    * add primary attribute’s score d4s
    * add ranks in primary skill d8s
    * add ranks in all relevant secondary skills d6s
* Add bonus and penalty dice to the die pool
* Roll all dice in the die pool
* For each penalty die one at a time remove the die with the highest score from the die pool
* From the remaining dice select the x highest where x is the character’s primary attribute score; the total of these selected dice plus any bonuses and penalties is the skill check’s result
* Compare the result to the action’s difficulty, for every 3 points by which the result exceeded the difficulty the action gains a success

### Combat and round based play:
Sometimes characters find themselves in stressful, potentially life or death, situations where the timing of each action becomes more important; at these times the game transitions from the normal player/GM narrative into round based play. In round based play characters declare and resolve their actions on their turns which happen in initiative order. Once all characters have acted the GM describes the updated scene; if the reason for round based play continues to be present recheck everyones initiative and begin another round.

##### Turns during round based combat:
Each character on their turn may take actions to move, attack, etc. All actions they may take have a cost in stamina, defense, or both as well as a turn requirement; a character may not declare multiple actions with a turn requirement of one or greater during their turn. An action’s turn requirement is simply how many turns a character must take in order to perform that action, an action with a turn requirement of zero may only be taken once per turn unless detailed otherwise in the actions description.
