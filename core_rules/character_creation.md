# Creating a character

### Simple Steps:
Creating characters can be done in a few simple steps. Before any number crunching or stat optimization is performed it is recommended that the GM and players discuss the game they plan on playing and work together to make characters that, as a group, will be likely to succeed and fun to play. It can also be good to put together a backstory for the character either before or after creation.
1. Determine power level of character being created.
1. Choose a strain from those the GM is allowing.
1. Assign attributes - each strain has a list of starting values for the four primary attributes as well as a number of attribute points that, plus any extra gained for the character’s power level, can be spent to improve these starting values. To increase an attribute by one costs one attribute point unless the attribute is already at double its starting value in which case it costs two attribute points.
1. Pick traits - like attributes points all character’s will have a number of trait points granted by their strain, and increased by the character’s power level. These can be spent to purchase general, arcane, or species specific traits. If the GM is allowing negative traits these may be taken but rather than costing trait points they provide their value in additional trait points; a GM allowing negative traits for player characters may choose to limit the maximum number of trait points gained from them.
1. Starting Languages - the GM, working with the players and story, will assign a number of, specific, bonus secondary skills to each character to ensure they are fluent in any languages they need to know for the campaign. These bonus points generally will not provide additional languages, written languages, or the like though they may be gained in steps 6-8.
1. Assign skills - each power level of character being created provides a skill array. Each number in the array can be assigned to one skill granting that many ranks in the base skill.
1. Secondary skills - for base skills at rank one or higher gain one rank in an associated secondary skill unless the character possesses a trait that over rules this for a given skill (such as the arcane traits).
1. Skills from traits - most character’s will have spent some trait points on the skilled trait. For each trait point spent in skilled the character gains one skill point that can be spent to gain one rank in a secondary skill providing doing so does not conflict with other rules, such as those from an arcane trait. Alternately a number of skill points equal to a basic skills current rank plus one can be spent to increase it by one rank, gaining a rank in a secondary skill in the process if this is the first rank in that base skill.
1. Gear and spells - work with the GM to determine what gear the character may begin the game in possession of. Characters with arcane traits also will create a spell list and check it with the GM.
1. The character starts the game with 5 plus their starting power level advancement points.

### Power Levels:
Each power level listed is designed to showcase different levels of adventurer; they list additional attribute and trait points the character gets as well as a list of primary skill ranks to be assigned during step six of character creation.
