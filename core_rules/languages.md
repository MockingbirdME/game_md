**Languages:** how well versed a character is in various spoken and written languages. Each language has a difficulty, which is reduced by the characterâ€™s basic skill ranks plus their rank in appropriate language group secondary skills plus twice their rank in the specific language's secondary skill(s). A character is fluent in a language when it's reduced to zero difficulty. Being fluent in a language, written or spoken, requires at least one rank in the language specific secondary skill.

**Written Languages**
Grailic Alphabet: Most writing in Flax uses the Grailic Alphabet, as a phonetic alphabet many languages that didn't have a historical written language of their own have adopted it. The Pureblooded Torleni and Rhosk have their own written languages that have not been replaced by the Grailic Alphabet and the Centari, with their recent arrival, use a strange combination of their historic writing and Grailic. Kaazt and Gargant both use a number of sounds that do not lend themselves well to being recorded with the Grailic Alphabet, though people have tried, and never developed their own writing.

Grailic Alphabet: 3
Centari Alphabet: 6 difficulty can be reduced by up to 2 from ranks in Grailic Alphabet.
Tor Symbology: 8
