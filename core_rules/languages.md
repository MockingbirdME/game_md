**Written Languages**
Grailic Alphabet: Most writing in Flax uses the Grailic Alphabet, as a phonetic alphabet many languages that didn't have a historical written language of their own have adopted it. The Pureblooded Torleni and Rhosk have their own written languages that have not been replaced by the Grailic Alphabet and the Centari, with their recent arrival, use a strange combination of their historic writing and Grailic. Kaazt and Gargant both use a number of sounds that do not lend themselves well to being recorded with the Grailic Alphabet, though people have tried, and never developed their own writing.
