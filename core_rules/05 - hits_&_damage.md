# Hits & Damage
<!-- TODO update wording throughout to use hex and add disclaimer that if not using a battle map the term hex correlates to roughly one square meter in theater of the mind -->
## Hitting and getting hit:
Most attacks are made as a melee or ranged combat skill check where the difficulty is equal to the defender's defense of with their relevant attack type bonus.
* Critical Failure:
* Failure: the attack misses with no effect.
* Near Success: if the skill check was a melee attack the defender loses one defense as they parry, block, or dodge the attack; if the skill check was a ranged attack compare the skill check's result to the defense of a random character within one meter of the defender, if the skill check equals or exceeds the difficulty to hit that character treat the attack as a hit on the second character and if it's a success that character is hit instead (ignore any other result including additional successes).
* Success: the attack hits causing the defender to lose two defense and suffer the effects of the attack.
* Additional successes: in addition to the success uses provided by the weapon or attack type all attacks can use the following additional successes:
    - Location hit arm or legs (1 success) - the attack strikes an arm or the legs of the defender as chosen by the attacker.
    - Location hit head (2 successes) - the attack strikes the defender's head.
    - Blunted attack _melee only_ (1 success) - an attack that would normally inflict penetrating damage may instead inflict concussive damage by striking with the flat of the blade or side of the spike.

## Targeting objects or hexes:
When making an attack there are times that the target is not another character but an object or an area (like a hex on the battle map if using miniatures).
* Targeting a stationary object: a stationary object has a defense value equal to 12 minus its size.
* Targeting a carried object: targeting an object that is carried or worn by another character requires a successful hit against the character with enough extra successes to target the body location where the item is being carried or worn plus 1-3 additional successes depending on the size of the object (GM's discretion is used to determine how many additional successes are needed to hit the specified location but this information should be made available if a player asks for it before attempting the attack).
* Targeting an area: to successfully hit a single hex on the map, if using a battle map, or roughly a square meter area if not using one with a melee weapon has a difficulty of 5, targeting the same area with a ranged weapon has a difficulty of 10 for close range +5 for each range increment. Targeting a hex with a character in it increases the difficulty by 5.

## Areas of Effect
Many items, spells, and abilities cause everything in an area to be affected. These effects originate from a hex or character. Once per round a character aware of an AOE they will end up in may accept two penalty dice to all actions on their next turn to move a number of meters equal to the greater of their ranks in personal defense and personal movement or spend a advancement point to move a number of meters equal to the sum of their ranks in those skills; add that advancement point to either their personal defense or personal movement skill.

## Hit locations:
Unless the hit location is already determined the attack is considered to have struck the character's body. Area effects generally damage the target’s body location and do not require a roll.

## Forms of damage
* Stamina - for every point of stamina damage dealt the victim loses one stamina.
* Stun - when a character suffers a stun they lose one stamina and gain a stun. If a character gained a stun last round they suffer a -1 penalty for each stun they have to every skill check they make. A character with a number of stuns equal to or greater than their max stamina is rendered unconscious and doesn't count their body attribute when reducing concussive damage.
* Fatigue - when a character suffers a point of fatigue they lose one stamina, and gain a point of fatigue; a point of fatigue is a special type of stun that can not be recovered with a restoration action and takes much longer to heal naturally.
* Wound - when a character suffers a wound they lose a stamina, gain a stun, gain a wound, and suffers a location specific effect (see below). All skill checks a wounded character makes gain a penalty die for each wound the character suffering from. A character with at least as many wounds as their max wound attribute is dying and rendered unable to act. A character that suffers a single hit/effect which inflicts at least as many wounds as their max wound attribute, or a character with a total number of wounds exceeding double their max wound attribute, dies immediately.
    * Head wounds - when a character suffers one or more wounds to the head they gain two additional stuns per wound suffered and can not reduce any action's turn requirement until the end of their next turn.
    * Arm wounds - when a character suffers any number of wounds to an arm they can not use that arm for actions on their next turn and loose any bonuses gained from equipment carried by that arm (parry, shield, etc.) until the end of their next turn, if they suffer two, or more, wounds at once they drop whatever they're holding in the associated hand and if they suffer three, or more, wounds at once the arm is rendered unusable until their wounds heal.
    * Leg wounds - when a character suffers wounds to their legs they can not spend stamina on move actions during their next turn and their base move is reduced by three per wound suffered (minimum 1) until the wounds are healed, if they suffer two, or more, wounds at once they are knocked prone, if they suffer three, or more, wounds at once they can not take any move actions other than to walk and their first move action each turn no longer has its turn requirement reduced until the wounds heal.
    * Body wounds - a character suffering wounds to the body suffer no additional penalties beyond those granted by having the wound(s).


### Dying and permanent injuries

#### Dying
A dying character may not act and becomes unconscious at the end of the round, if not already. A character who is dying must receive medical attention within X rounds where X is one plus their rank in the Endurance primary skill or they suffer an additional wound caused by blood loss and internal injury, suffering this effect additional times adds additional level one injuries. A character who receives proper medical attention does not continue dying but does remain unconscious, or unable to perform most actions, until they have healed at least one wound. A character suffering more wounds than their max wounds attribute can not recover stamina or remove stuns or fatigue.

#### Permanent Injuries(optional) TBA

## Recovering from damage

#### Recovering from minor injuries
* Stamina - a character can regain stamina during combat by taking a recovery action, outside of combat a character's stamina is reset to their max stamina after a minute of relaxing inactivity or five minutes of un-strenuous activity.
* Stun - a character can remove stuns during combat by taking a recovery action, outside of combat a character looses one stun for every minute of rest or 5 minutes of un-strenuous activity.
* Fatigue - recovering from fatigue requires rest, a character spending a full hour at rest looses one fatigue, a character looses twice as much fatigue for time spent sleeping. At the GM's discretion fatigue caused by specific conditions may recover faster if the opposite condition is met (ex. fatigue caused by prolonged exposure to cold may recover faster while sitting at a warm hearth while fatigue caused by dehydration and sun exposure may recover faster while resting in the shade with a pitcher of fruit juice).

#### Recovering from wounds
Recovering from wounds is a slow process. Each day a character spends mostly at rest and with no strenuous activity, or each week they spend not resting properly, they may make a recovery check. A recovery check a skill check with a primary attribute of body, no primary skill, with a number of penalty dice equal to the total number of wounds the character is suffering from; bonus dice may be added to this check by certain traits and by medical assistance. Compare the result to the chart below to find the effects of the recovery check.
| Recovery check total | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 0-5  | The character is not healing properly, their wounds become infected and they develop sepsis, they gain an additional wound and suffers a penalty die to their next recovery check.  |
| 6-9  | The character's wounds are getting infected, they gain one additional wound.  |
| 10-12  | The character is stable, they neither gain or recover any wounds.  |
| 13-16  | The character is healing well, they recover one wound.  |
| 17-20  | The character is healing quickly, they recover one wound and gain a bonus die to all recovery rolls until suffering any additional wounds. |
| 21+  | The character is healing at a miraculous rate, they recover two wounds and gain a bonus die to all recovery rolls until they suffer any additional wounds. |

## Damage Types
#### Concussive damage
Concussive damage is reduced by the character’s body stat and physical damage resistance.

| Damage | stamina/stun/wound | Damage | stamina/stun/wound
| --- | --- | ---| ---
| 1 | 1 stamina | 10 | 1 wound + 2 stun
| 2 | 2 stamina | 13 | 2 wounds + 1 stun
| 3 | 1 stun + 1 stamina | 17 | 3 wounds
| 5 | 2 stuns | 21 | 4 wounds
| 7 | 3 stuns| every additional 4 | +1 wound, +1 stun

#### Penetrating damage
Penetrating damage with armor piercing value less than the target’s armor value becomes concussive. Penetrating damage is reduced by the character’s physical damage resistance.

| Damage | stamina/stun/wound | Damage | stamina/stun/wound |
| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| 0 | 1 stamina | 7 | 2 wounds |
| 1 | 1 stun | 10 | 3 wounds |
| 2 | 2 stuns | 13 | 5 wounds |
| 4 | 1 wound, 1 stun | every additional | +1 wound |

#### Fire damage
Fire damage is reduced by any fire resistance the character may have. Fire damage causes burning; the character suffers the same damage -1 next round to the burning body location, if this damage was itself caused by burning randomly determined one adjacent body location to also suffer this damage next round; if a body location would suffer multiple instances of burning only resolve the most severe one. Any character with one hand free within one meter of a burning character may take an action, with a one turn requirement, to reduce all burning damage they would suffer next round by 3, this reduction is increased to 5 if the burning character is prone; a character with two free hands may double this reduction.

|Damage | stamina/stun/wound | Damage | stamina/stun/wound
| --- | --- | ---| ---
| 1 | 1 stamina | 8 | 1 wound, burning
| 3 | 1 stun | 13 | 2 wounds, burning
| 5 | 1 stun, burning | every additional 5 | +1 wound, burning|

#### Cold damage
Cold damage is reduced by a character’s body stat plus any cold resistance they may have. Cold damage gains +1 for every round the target has suffered cold damage since they were last warm.

| Damage | stamina/stun/wound | Damage | stamina/stun/wound
| --- | --- | ---| ---
|1 | 1 stamina | 13 | 2 fatigue, 1 wound
| 3 | 2 stamina | 17 | 3 fatigue, 1 wound
| 5 | 1 fatigue | 21 | 4 fatigue, 2 wounds
| 8 | 2 fatigue | every additional 3 | +1 fatigue, +1/2 wound

#### Lightning damage
Lightning damage is reduced by the character’s body, armor value that is gained from metal armor, and by any lightning resistance they may have. Lightning damage is always inflicted to the body location.

| Damage | stamina/stun/wound | Damage | stamina/stun/wound
| --- | --- | ---| ---
| 0 or less | recovers 1 stamina | 8 | 3 stuns
| 1 | 1 stamina | 10 | 3 stuns,  wound
| 2 | 1 stun | Every additional 3 | +1 stun
| 5 | 2 stuns | every additional 10| +1 wound

#### Arcane Dues
A character suffers a number of points of arcane dues equal to the total number of successes in an effect the mage casts or creates. Arcane dues is handled in three steps, first reduce the dues by up to the character’s body stat lose a stamina per point reduced, then reduce the remainder by up to the character’s body stat taking one fatigue per point reduced, finally take a number of wounds equal to the remaining points to the character’s body location.
