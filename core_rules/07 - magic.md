# Magic

## Creating Magical Effects
Mages craft magic by gathering energy and shaping it to the effect they desire; crafting can be dangerous as the amount of power summoned is unpredictable. Alternatively mages can cast prepared, practiced, effects called spells. A cast spell can be made safer by have its power restricted, a practice called gating the spell.

#### Crafting magic
Mages gather arcane power into themselves before shaping it once they've gathered the desired amount of power. Crafting magic allows a mage to create any effect for which they can imagine from the powers they they have access to but doing so is can be both time consuming and dangerous.  

#### Casting a spell
Spells are like crafted magic but they have been well rehearsed with their effects being pre determined; spells are, generally, much safer for the mage than crafting magic is. Spells can be cast with very exact specification is gated or with a more power and variation if cast ungated.

#### Casting spells and Crafting magic over time
Spells and crafted effects do not need to be cast quickly, by taking extra time in the ritual the caster's body stat is treated as being higher than it naturally is, this bonus is plus 1 for taking a minute, plus 2 for taking half an hour, and plus 3 for taking four full hours and plus 4 for taking a full day. After the arcane dues are applied for a ritually cast spell or effect the caster suffers additional fatigue equal to the bonus gained to their body stat squared.

#### Group magic
A group of mages can work together to create a larger effect than any individual mage could control. The mages all collectively gather and shape power channeling the bits of it individually with a lead mage finalizing the effect. To calculate arcane dues first have each mage suffer dues for the successes they gathered and shaped then the lead mage suffers arcane dues equal to the total number of successes in the effect, he can shunt off any amount of this to the other mages participating in the spell, any non lead mage that dies as a result of arcane dues sends the remainder of the dues they would suffer back to the lead mage and should a lead mage die as a result of the arcane dues the remainder is inflicted, in full, to all remaining living participants. Group magic takes at least 1 minute per participating mage, they can take extra time to increase their effective body stat, as above, increasing the cast time to 10 minutes per participant to have each mage gain 1 to their body stat for calculating arcane dues, 2 hours per participant to increase this bonus to 2, or a full day for each participant to increase this bonus to 3.

#### Spell lists and creating spells
Each mage may know a number of spells equal to half their rank in the mind attribute (round up) and may change or modify them between adventures. Mages gain a number of free successes they may add to their spells when designing them, these successes may be distributed as the mage wishes between one or more spells; for each arcane aptitude secondary skill the mage has at least one rank in they may assign one free success to one spell on their spell list, this success must be spent on an effect the secondary skill provides, and for each rank in arcane aptitude the mage gains one free success that can be spent on any effect the mage has access to. Once the mage has determined the basic idea of the spells in his spell list that will utilize free successes they may design their spells.

steps in designing spells -
1. determine the basic idea of what the spell will do.
2. determine number of free successes, if any, and what they will be used for.
3. determine which secondary skills will be used to create the spell’s effects.
4. for each secondary skill relevant to the spell list a number of success uses equal to the character’s ranks in that secondary skill.
5. list a number of additional success uses equal to the character’s rank in arcane aptitude, these can be any arcane success use the character has access to.
6. list the chosen success uses with the free ones first and the rest in the order of importance to the spell the mage is looking to make.
7. determine at which points in this list of successes the spell meets the desires of the mage and place its gate there.
8. record the spell’s name, number of successes to cast at the gate, cost gated (the total number of successes in the spell, including free ones), cost modifier (recorded as a +X in parentheses after the cost) which is equal to the number of free successes in the spell, the secondary skills relevant to the spell, and the summation of all effects up to the gate listed as the spell effect and all remaining successes, those after the gate, listed in no particular order as the spells pool.


*Example spell design - the beginner learned mage Rodrick Leesen has 3 ranks in arcane aptitude, 2 ranks in the fire arcane theme, 1 rank in the space arcane theme, and one rank in the water arcane theme.*
1. *Rodrick wishes to craft a fireball spell, he determines it will need to be ranged and inflict fire damage in an area.*
2. *For this spell he wants to add his free success gained from his ranks in the fire secondary skill, saving his free successes for space and water for other spells. He determines that he will put the free success towards creating wizard’s fire, noting, from it’s description, that he will require a second and third success to create it.*
3. *This spell looks to include fire to create wizard’s fire and possibly to control temperature to make it deal more damage. It will also include space for Enhance Spell Range, blast AOE, and potentially 3D AOE.*
4. *For fire Rodrick needs to list two success uses (because he has two ranks in the spell), he uses them to be the needed extra successes to create wizards fire. He has only a single listed effect for space and chooses to put it towards burst AOE.*
5. *Rodrick has three ranks in arcane aptitude so chooses to put one rank towards throw spell, an effect any mage can produce, another success to in burst AOE, and the last one in Enhance range.*
6. *In order Rodrick lists the success: wizard’s fire(free), wizard’s fire, wizard’s fire, throw spell, burst AOE, burst AOE, enhance spell range.*
7. *Rodrick thinks the enhanced range and the second burst AOE won’t always be needed and decides to put the spell’s gate before those success.*
8. *Rodrick records his spell as follows:*

  **Fireball -** *difficulty: 4 successes, cost: 5(+1), secondary skills: fire and space
  Range of 5m close, 5m increment, and 15m max.
  AOE - 2m diameter blast.
  Damage - 2d4 fire damage.
  Pool: enhance range, burst AOE.*

  *When Rodrick casts the spell gated he needs only to roll 4 successes (12) to get the basic effects of his spell, if he casts it ungated he gets all successes rolled; if he rolls 4 or 5 successes the spell happens as if it were gated, though he takes arcane dues equal to the total successes rolled plus the free successes in the spell, if he rolls six successes he can choose to add either an enhance range or a burst AOE success to the effect and if he rolls seven or more successes he can an enhanced range or a burst AOE effect for each success mixing and matching as he chooses.*

  **Note -** *Many lower level mages choose to gate their spells after the last successes they could assign to it, never casting it ungated; this gives them the most power for the lowest difficulty. Higher level mages often gate their spells quite low so that they can have more variety with the spell's effects when they cast it ungated.

#### Cantrips
Mages, in addition to their spells, know a number of cantrips. Mages start knowing three cantrips but may spend 5 advancement points to gain an additional cantrip slot. In between adventures a mage my change what cantrips they know.

A cantrip is a lot like a spell with the following exceptions: it does not benefit from any free successes, the maximum number of successes in the cantrip is equal to the mages rank in arcane aptitude, the maximum number of successes in a cantrip in one power is equal to the character's rank in that power's secondary skill, use the casting a cantrip action instead of the cast spell action when casting a cantrip in combat, no skill check is required to cast a cantrip.
