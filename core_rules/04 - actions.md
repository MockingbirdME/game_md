# Actions

## The skill check
When a character may wishes to attempt an action where success is not certain and failure is not guaranteed, or when a character’s degree of success or failure matters, the GM may call for a skill check.

### Important terms for a skill check
* Primary attribute - the primary attribute most relevant to the action being taken.
* Primary skill - the primary skill most relevant to the action being taken.
* Die pool - dice rolled when making a skill check.
* Bonus/Penalty dice - extra d6s added to the die pool.

### Steps for making a skill check
* Declare the action the character intends to take
* Determine if action requires a skill check
* Determine primary attribute, and primary skill
* Build die pool
    * add primary attribute’s score d4s
    * add ranks in primary skill d8s
* Add bonus and penalty dice to the die pool
* Roll all dice in the die pool
* For each penalty die, one at a time, remove the die with the highest score from the die pool
* From the remaining dice select the X highest dice where X is equal to the primary attribute score; the total of these selected dice is the skill check’s result.
* Compare the result to the action’s difficulty, and determine the result.

#### Skill Check Results
Compare the skill check result to its difficulty and resolve the action as follows:
* __Critical Failure__ (Result is less than half the difficulty) - the skill check fails badly, the GM should consider some negative result based on the check in question if it is not explicitly detailed in the skill check description (a crafting check wastes the materials that would be used, a movement check results in the character tripping and falling, etc.).
* __Failure__ (Result is greater than half the difficulty but less than the difficulty minus five) - the skill check fails with no benefit or penalty.
* __Near Failure__ (Result is less than, but within five, of the difficulty) - the skill check fails but makes some progression towards a future success.
* __Success__ (Result is equal to or greater than the difficulty) - the skill check succeeds!
* __Additional Successes__ (Result is at least three greater than the difficulty) - for every three points by which the result exceeded the difficulty the action gains an additional success granting some additional benefit to the skill check.


## Skill Checks
There may never be an exhaustive list of all potential skill checks to be made in a game but below is a list of common checks that may need to be made. GM's should feel free to modify the difficulties or results of any given skill check.

### Active Skill Checks
Most skill checks are made as part of an action taken by the character these skill checks should only be rolled when the character takes the appropriate action.
