# Actions

## The skill check:
When a character may wishes to attempt an action where success is not certain and failure is not guaranteed, or when a character’s degree of success or failure matters, the GM may call for a skill check.

#### Important terms for a skill check:
* Primary attribute - the primary attribute most relevant to the action being taken.
* Primary skill - the primary skill most relevant to the action being taken.
* Die pool - dice rolled when making a skill check.
* Bonus/Penalty dice - extra d6s added to the die pool.

#### Steps for making a skill check:
* Declare the action the character intends to take
* Determine if action requires a skill check
* Determine primary attribute, and primary skill
* Build die pool
    * add primary attribute’s score d4s
    * add ranks in primary skill d8s
* Add bonus and penalty dice to the die pool
* Roll all dice in the die pool
* For each penalty die, one at a time, remove the die with the highest score from the die pool
* From the remaining dice select a number of dice of your choice (generally those with the greatest results) equal to the primary attribute score; the total of these selected dice is the skill check’s result
* Compare the result to the action’s difficulty, for every 3 points by which the result exceeded the difficulty the action gains a success

#### Roll-less skill checks (take standard/take time) *NOTE* these need better terms
When a player wishes to not risk a poor roll during a skill check they may take a standard result or, if the character is not rushed, take their time. Opposed or attack skill checks can never be made roll-lessly. Roll-less skill checks follow these alternate steps:
* Declare the action the character intends to take
* Determine if action requires a skill check
* Determine primary attribute and primary skill
* Calculate successes:
    * add the primary attribute, halved for standard, plus one to successes
    * add the primary skill's rank to successes
    * add half the number of bonus dice as successes
    * Remove one successes for every penalty die, halved for time taken.
* Apply your total successes, ignoring any partial success, to the action being taken

## Combat and round based play:
Sometimes characters find themselves in stressful, potentially life or death, situations where the timing of each action becomes more important; at these times the game transitions from the normal player/GM narrative into round based play. In round based play characters declare and resolve their actions on their turns which happen in initiative order. Once all characters have acted the GM describes the updated scene; if the reason for round based play continues to be present recheck everyones initiative and begin another round.

#### Turns during round based combat:
Each character on their turn may take actions to move, attack, etc. All actions they may take have a cost in stamina, defense, or both as well as a turn requirement; a character may not declare multiple actions with a turn requirement of one or greater during their turn. An action’s turn requirement is simply how many turns a character must take in order to perform that action, an action with a standard turn requirement of zero may only be taken once per turn unless detailed otherwise in the actions description.

## Action options by type:
Actions are are detailed with a name followed by it’s stamina cost in parentheses and a description.

#### Melee Actions:
Unless stated otherwise, melee actions have a turn requirement of one that can be reduced to zero at the cost of a penalty die added to this skill check and all other skill checks this turn.

#### Combat Modifiers:
Various conditions can affect a combat situation, changing the difficult to hit a target.
* **Kneeling or prone** - kneeling characters gain +2 ranged defense and -3 melee defense and lose 3 meters distance when making a movement action. Prone characters triple these effects.
* **Behind cover** - a +1 to +9 defense bonus against attacks made from the other side of the cover. Attacks missing due to this bonus damage the cover. If a character is gaining cover from more than one source such as being partially hidden behind a low wall and they are wielding a shield, they gain the cover bonus of whichever is greater plus one for each additional piece of cover up to a maximum of +9 after which the character is completely covered and can not be attacked.
* **Concealed** - like cover, concealment grants a variable defense bonus based on completeness of it.
* **Flanking** - if a character has multiple opponents in melee range and at least one is outside their front arc they suffer a -1 penalty to their melee defense for each opponent contributing to the situation.
* **Wind** - depending on the strength and regularity of the wind, ranged attack skill checks receive up to five penalty dice, heavier or smaller projectiles should receive lesser penalties and massless ranged magical effects do not suffer ranged penalties from wind.
* **Reach** - against a character with greater reach than your melee attack’s add one penalty die plus one for every five points by which their reach exceeds yours to the attack’s skill check or grant your opponent a free strike against you. This penalty is incurred the first time you attack this target since engaging or their last defensive action.
* **Free attack** - once per round when an opponent moves through a hex the character threatens the character may immediately make a basic attack against that opponent with zero turn requirement.
