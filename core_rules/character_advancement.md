# Character and party advancement

### Advancement points
At character creation they gain 5, or more, advancement points. Advancement points are spent to grant the character in game advantages and to increase their skill and attribute ranks over time.

##### In game uses
Only one advancement point can be spent by a character at each opportunity. When a character spends an advancement point in one of these ways they add it to the most appropriate primary skill for the situation.
* A character may spend an advancement point to gain one bonus die, or ignore one penalty die to a skill check they are about to make. Add the advancement point to the primary skill.
* Add one success to a skill check that the character just made that met it's difficulty, if any. Add the advancement point to the primary skill used in that skill check.
* A character may spend an advancement point to grant another character a bonus die or allow that character to ignore a penalty die to a skill check they are about to make if they can role play how they are doing so. Add the advancement point to the primary skill being used to make the check or most closely related to how they are making helping.
* A character may reduce the damage they have just taken by 3, this can not be used to reduce arcane dues. The Advancement point is added to the character's Endurance skill.

##### Out of game uses
When not actively playing a character may spend advancement points to increase their ranks in skills and attributes or gain traits. Doing so requires that the character has an appropriate amount of time to do so, as a general rule no more than 1 advancement point should be spent per 10 hours of training without an instructor or 5 hours with one but tailor this to your story. It is perfectly acceptable to break up this training, spending a few advancement points at a time and increasing the character's rank in a skill/attribute or gaining a trait once the appropriate number of points have been spent.
* Increasing an Attribute - Increasing an attribute costs 6 times it's new rank advancement points.
* Increasing a Primary Skill - Increasing a primary skill costs 3 times its new rank advancement points. When a primary skill is increased to rank 1 also gain rank 1 in one of its associated secondary skills.
* Increasing a Secondary Skill - Increasing a secondary skill costs 1 plus its new rank advancement points.
* Gaining a Trait - Gaining a new trait requires GM approval and costs 3 times its trait point cost in advancement points.

##### Gaining advancement points
At the end of each session or scene the GM should award one or more advancement points based on the accomplishments and experience of the characters. The number of advancement points granted will vary based on the speed the GM wants the characters increase in power, for standard power progression it is recommended that characters gain between 3 and 10 advancement points per session for a typical campaign. GMs are encouraged to provide all characters with an equal number of advancement points each session.

It's a good practice to keep track of how many character points have been awarded over the duration of a campaign to make it easier to bring in new characters at an equal power level to those that are already in the campaign.
