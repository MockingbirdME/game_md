# Character and party advancement

### Advancement points
At character creation they gain 5, or more, advancement points. Advancement points are spent to grant the character in game advantages and to increase their skill and attribute ranks over time.

##### In game uses
* Gain +5 to the result of a skill check that did not meet its difficulty. Add the advancement point to the primary skill. Limit one per skill check.
* Add one success to a skill check that the character just made that met it's difficulty. Add the advancement point to the primary skill used in that skill check. Limit one per skill check.
* Reduce the damage they have just taken by 3, this can not be used to reduce arcane dues. The advancement point is added to either the character's endurance skill or body attribute, player's choice.
* Ignore all penalty dice for one skill check. Add the advancement point the endurance skill or the primary skill used in the skill check.
* Take one action, with a turn requirement of zero and that has had all prerequisites met, outside of your turn. Add the advancement point to the primary skill being used. Limit once per round.

##### Out of game uses
When not actively playing a character may spend advancement points to increase their ranks in skills and attributes or gain traits. Doing so requires that the character has an appropriate amount of time to do so, as a general rule no more than 1 advancement point should be spent per 10 hours of training without an instructor or 5 hours with one but tailor this to your story. It is perfectly acceptable to break up this training, spending a few advancement points at a time and increasing the character's rank in a skill/attribute or gaining a trait once the appropriate number of points have been spent.
* Increasing an Attribute - Increasing an attribute costs 6 times its new rank advancement points.
* Increasing a Primary Skill - Increasing a primary skill costs 3 times its new rank advancement points. When a primary skill is increased to rank 1 also gain rank 1 in one of its associated secondary skills.
* Increasing a Secondary Skill - Increasing a secondary skill costs 1 plus its new rank advancement points.
* Gaining a Trait - Gaining a new trait requires GM approval and costs 3 times its trait point cost in advancement points.

##### Gaining advancement points
At the end of each session or scene the GM should award one or more advancement points based on the accomplishments and experience of the characters. The number of advancement points granted will vary based on the speed the GM wants the characters increase in power, for standard power progression it is recommended that characters gain between 3 and 10 advancement points per session for a typical campaign. GMs are encouraged to provide all characters with an equal number of advancement points each session.

It's a good practice to keep track of how many character points have been awarded over the duration of a campaign to make it easier to bring in new characters at an equal power level to those that are already in the campaign.
