# Attributes

## Primary Attributes:
Character’s have four primary attributes that describe their physical and mental talents. Primary attributes play a key role in determining a character’s potential for success in various actions.
* **Body** - a character’s strength, stamina, and toughness.
* **Reflexes** - how quickly a character moves or reacts.
* **Perception** - how well tuned the character’s senses are.
* **Mind** - a character’s learning and mental discipline.

## Secondary Attributes:
These statistics and resources are derived from the character’s strain, primary attributes, and skills.
* **Size** - determined by a character’s strain and traits.
* **Reach** - equal to the character’s size.
* **Melee defense bonus** - added to a character’s defense against melee attacks they are aware of. This bonus is equal to a character’s ranks in melee combat and the parry secondary skill.
* **Ranged defense bonus** - added to a character’s defense against ranged attacks they are aware of. This bonus is equal to the sum of a character’s ranks in alertness and the dodge secondary skill.
* **Max. Wounds** - a character with this many wounds will soon die without medical attention. Max wounds is equal to the average(round up) of the character’s body stat and size.
* **Movement** - equal to 3 + the character’s size + their ranks in personal movement.
### Resources:
These attributes can be depleted, the maximum amount of the resource a character can have is the listed stat.
* **Defense** - a measure of how hard a character is to hit. A character’s defense is equal to 10 + reflexes + perception + twice their rank in personal defense - their size.
* **Stamina** - a measure of how much energy a character has. A character’s stamina is equal to 10 + body + ranks in Endurance + ranks in the stamina secondary skill.
* **Initiative** (optional) - a measure of how quickly the character acts. Initiative is equal to the sum of a character’s current defense and current stamina.

# Skills

## Primary Skills:
Primary skills are broad categories of learned or trained abilities a character has accumulated. The number of ranks a character has in a primary skill is used to add dice or successes to a skill check, some secondary attributes are also affected by the number of ranks a character possesses in certain primary skills.

## Secondary Skills:
Secondary skills individually represent subsets of, or specializations in, a primary skill it is associated with. Ranks in secondary skills have not static effect but are referenced in many other areas to add bonus dice to skill rolls, increase secondary attributes, and otherwise enhance the results of an action.
