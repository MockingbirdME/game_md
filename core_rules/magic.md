# Magic

### Creating Magical Effects
Mages craft magic by gathering energy and shaping it to the effect they desire; crafting can be dangerous as the amount of power summoned is unpredictable. Alternatively mages can cast prepared, practiced, effects called spells. A cast spell can be made safer by have its power restricted, called gating the spell.

##### Crafting magic
The mage may take an action to summon forth magic to shape on subsequent turns. The character makes an arcane aptitude skill check with mind as the primary attribute, they may choose to make any arcane theme or magical power secondary skills were relevant to this check but must keep track of which ones they have used, the result of this skill check divided by three should be added to the number of successes the character has to shape. The character must either continue to gather power or shape the power they have already gathered on their next turn, if in turn based combat, or before they do anything else, if out of combat. When the character shapes the power they have gathered they may spend each success on magical powers they know spending at least one successes on a power related to each secondary skill they used in their skill check for each rank they possesses in that secondary skill times the number of skill checks they used the secondary skill in while gathering power. Once the character has assigned each gathered success to some effect they suffer arcane dues equal to the total number of successes worth of gathered power in the effect plus on per round used to gather the power, if they survive the arcane dues the effect as they detailed is successfully created.

##### Casting a spell
Spells are like crafted magic but they have been well rehearsed with their effects being pre determined; spells are, generally, much safer for the mage than crafting magic is. When casting a spell the mage will select one spell from their spell list, make a skill check using mind, arcane aptitude, and whatever secondary skills the spell lists as relevant, if the skill check total equals or exceeds the difficulty of the spell the effects as listed, including arcane dues, happen. A character wishing to cast a spell with more power than normal may choose to cast it ungated, this allows for any successes rolled past the difficulty of the spell to add more power to it as determined when the spell was created. If a character attempting to cast a spell does not meet the difficulty of the spell the cast fails and they suffer one point of fatigue.

##### Spell lists and creating spells
Each mage type may know a maximum number of spells at any given point; dependent mages may know a number of spells equal to their ranks in arcane aptitude, learned mages know up to the greater of half their mind score or the number of arcane aptitude secondary skills they know, and natural mages know a number of spells equal to half their ranks in arcane aptitude plus one for each arcane theme secondary skill they have ranks in. Mages gain a number of free successes they may add to their spells when designing them, these successes may be distributed as the mage wishes between one or more spells; for each rank in an arcane aptitude secondary skill the mage has he may assign one free success to one spell in his spell list, this success must be spent on an effect the secondary skill provides, and for each rank in arcane aptitude the mage gains one free success that can be spent on any effect the mage has access to. Once the mage has determined the basic idea of the spells in his spell list that will utilize free successes he may design the spells.

steps in designing spells -
1. determine the basic idea of what the spell will do.
2. determine number of free successes, if any, and what they will be used for.
3. determine which secondary skills will be used to create the spell’s effects.
4. for each secondary skill relevant to the spell list a number of successes uses equal to the character’s ranks in that secondary skill.
5. list a number of additional successes uses equal to the character’s rank in arcane aptitude, these can be any success use the character knows.
6. list the chosen successes uses with the free ones first and the rest in the order of importance to the spell the mage is looking to make.
7. determine at which point in this list of successes the spell meets the desires of the mage and put its gate there.
8. record the spell’s name, difficulty to cast gated (number of successes not counting free ones, times three), cost (the total number of successes in the spell, including free ones), secondary skills included in the spell, the summation of all effects up to where the spell was gated and a list of the remaining successes in order.


*Example spell design - the beginner learned mage Rodrick Leesen has 3 ranks in arcane aptitude, 2 ranks in the fire arcane theme, 1 rank in the space arcane theme, and one rank in the water arcane theme.*
1. *Rodrick wishes to craft a fireball spell, he determines it will need to be ranged and inflict fire damage in an area.*
2. *For this spell he wants to add both of his free successes gained from his ranks in the fire secondary skill, saving his free successes for space and water for other spells. He determines that he will put the free successes towards creating wizard’s fire, noting, from it’s description, that he will require a third success to create it.*
3. *This spell looks to include fire to create wizard’s fire and possibly to control temperature to make it deal more damage. It will also include space for Enhance Range, blast AOE, and potentially 3D AOE.*
4. *For fire Rodrick needs to list two success uses, he uses one to be the needed third success to create wizards fire and one to control the temperature to increase it’s damage. He has only a single listed effect for space and chooses to put it towards burst AOE.*
5. *Rodrick has three ranks in arcane aptitude so chooses to put one rank towards throw spell, an effect any mage can produce, another success to in burst AOE, and the last one in Enhance range.*
6. *In order Rodrick lists the success: wizard’s fire(free), wizard’s fire(free), wizard’s fire, throw spell, burst AOE, burst AOE , control heat, enhance range.*
7. *Rodrick thinks the enhanced range won’t always be needed and decides to put the spell’s gate before before that success.*
8. *Rodrick records his spell as follows:*

  **Fireball -** *difficulty: 15, cost: 7, secondary skills: fire and space
  Range of 13m, close, increment, and max.
  AOE - 2m radius blast
  Damage - 2d4 + 1d6 fire damage.
  Ungated: 1 additional success increases max range to 26m.*

##### Cantrips
Mages, in addition to their spells, know a number of cantrips. Mages start knowing three cantrips but may spend 3 character points to gain an additional cantrip slot. In between adventures a mage my change what cantrips they know.

A cantrip is a lot like a spell with the following exceptions: it does not benefit from any free successes, the maximum number of successes in the cantrip is equal to the mages mind stat or rank in arcane aptitude (whichever is greater), the maximum number of successes in a cantrip in one power is equal to the character's rank in that powers secondary skill, use the casting a cantrip action instead of the cast spell action when casting a cantrip in combat, no skill check is required to cast a cantrip.
