# Magic

### Creating Magical Effects
Mages craft magic by gathering energy and shaping it to the effect they desire; crafting can be dangerous as the amount of power summoned is unpredictable. Alternatively mages can cast prepared, practiced, effects called spells. A cast spell can be made safer by have its power restricted, called gating the spell.

##### Crafting magic
The mage may take an action to summon forth magic to shape on subsequent turns. The character must either continue to gather power or shape the power they have already gathered on their next turn, if in turn based combat, or before they do anything else, if out of combat. When the character shapes the power they have gathered they may spend each success on magical powers they know. Once the character has assigned each gathered success to some effect they suffer arcane dues equal to the total number of successes worth of gathered power in the effect plus on per round used to gather the power and the effect as they detailed is successfully created.

##### Casting a spell
Spells are like crafted magic but they have been well rehearsed with their effects being pre determined; spells are, generally, much safer for the mage than crafting magic is. When casting a spell the mage will select one spell from their spell list, choose a gate on it, then make a skill check using mind, arcane aptitude, and no relevant secondary skills, if the skill results in at least as many successes as needed to cast the spell the effects as listed, including arcane dues, happen. A character wishing to cast a spell with more power than normal may choose to cast it ungated, this allows for any successes rolled past the difficulty of the spell to add more power to it as determined when the spell was created.

##### Spell lists and creating spells
Each mage may know a number of spells equal to the greater of half their rank in the mind attribute (round up) or half the number of arcane aptitude secondary skills (round down). Mages gain a number of free successes they may add to their spells when designing them, these successes may be distributed as the mage wishes between one or more spells; for each arcane aptitude secondary skill the mage has they may assign one free success to one spell in his spell list, this success must be spent on an effect the secondary skill provides, and for each rank in arcane aptitude the mage gains one free success that can be spent on any effect the mage has access to. Once the mage has determined the basic idea of the spells in his spell list that will utilize free successes he may design the spells.

steps in designing spells -
1. determine the basic idea of what the spell will do.
2. determine number of free successes, if any, and what they will be used for.
3. determine which secondary skills will be used to create the spell’s effects.
4. for each secondary skill relevant to the spell list a number of success uses equal to the character’s ranks in that secondary skill.
5. list a number of additional successes uses equal to the character’s rank in arcane aptitude, these can be any arcane success use the character has access to.
6. list the chosen success uses with the free ones first and the rest in the order of importance to the spell the mage is looking to make.
7. determine at which point in this list of successes the spell meets the desires of the mage and put its gate.
8. record the spell’s name, number of successes to cast at each gate, cost gated (the total number of successes in the spell, including free ones), the secondary skills relevant to the spell, and the summation of all effects in order with the gates clearly marked.


*Example spell design - the beginner learned mage Rodrick Leesen has 3 ranks in arcane aptitude, 2 ranks in the fire arcane theme, 1 rank in the space arcane theme, and one rank in the water arcane theme.*
1. *Rodrick wishes to craft a fireball spell, he determines it will need to be ranged and inflict fire damage in an area.*
2. *For this spell he wants to add his free success gained from his ranks in the fire secondary skill, saving his free successes for space and water for other spells. He determines that he will put the free success towards creating wizard’s fire, noting, from it’s description, that he will require a second and third success to create it.*
3. *This spell looks to include fire to create wizard’s fire and possibly to control temperature to make it deal more damage. It will also include space for Enhance Spell Range, blast AOE, and potentially 3D AOE.*
4. *For fire Rodrick needs to list two success uses (because he has two ranks in the spell), he uses them to be the needed extra successes to create wizards fire. He has only a single listed effect for space and chooses to put it towards burst AOE.*
5. *Rodrick has three ranks in arcane aptitude so chooses to put one rank towards throw spell, an effect any mage can produce, another success to in burst AOE, and the last one in Enhance range.*
6. *In order Rodrick lists the success: wizard’s fire(free), wizard’s fire, wizard’s fire, throw spell, burst AOE, burst AOE, enhance spell range.*
7. *Rodrick thinks the enhanced range won’t always be needed and decides to put the spell’s gate before before that success.*
8. *Rodrick records his spell as follows:*

  **Fireball -** *difficulty: 5 successes, cost: 6, secondary skills: fire and space
  Range of 5m close, 5m increment, and 15m max.
  AOE - 3m diameter blast.
  Damage - 2d4 fire damage.
  Ungated: 1 additional success double's the spell's ranges.*

##### Cantrips
Mages, in addition to their spells, know a number of cantrips. Mages start knowing three cantrips but may spend 5 advancement points to gain an additional cantrip slot. In between adventures a mage my change what cantrips they know.

A cantrip is a lot like a spell with the following exceptions: it does not benefit from any free successes, the maximum number of successes in the cantrip is equal to the mages rank in arcane aptitude, the maximum number of successes in a cantrip in one power is equal to the character's rank in that powers secondary skill, use the casting a cantrip action instead of the cast spell action when casting a cantrip in combat, no skill check is required to cast a cantrip.
