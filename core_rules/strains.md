# Strains

### Basics:
Strains are the intelligent species of Flax that, generally, consider themselves persons. Not all strains are treated equally in all societies or by each other. The strains listed as primary strains can be found in all nations of Flax and, generally, recognize each other as persons, while those listed as secondary are either less common, considered inferior by other strains, or both. Each strain has a series of stats as described below:
* ***Physical Appearance -*** a brief physical description of the strain.
* ***Origin -*** many strains trace their origins back to the Ohma who created them.
* ***Size -*** the starting size attribute (before traits) for members of this strain.
* ***Base Attributes -*** the starting value of each of the four primary attributes before they are increased during character creation.
* ***Attribute points -*** the number of points members of this strain have to spend on increasing their attributes during character creation. Increasing a base attribute by one point cost one attribute point providing that attribute has a score of less than twice its base value; once an attribute's value is double its base value it costs two attribute points to increase further.
* ***Required Traits -*** these are traits, that may or may not be available to other strains, that every member of the strain possesses.
* ***Strain Traits -*** some strains have access to, but are not required to take, certain traits that are not available to everyone; they, if available, will be listed here.
* ***Arcane Traits -*** not all strains have access to every arcane trait; the arcane traits available to the strain, along with their cost will be listed here.
* ***Build points -*** not all strains are equally powerful, to balance this out during character creation they will apply this modifier to how many build points they have to use during character creation. If the modifier would reduce the total number of available build points to below 10 it is suggested that the strain not be used at that power level for a PC.

### Primary strains:

##### Centeen
So similar to Sapeen that, but for their dusky skin, they would be mistaken for them; they are in fact so similar that they are capable of interbreeding with no complications.

***Physical Appearance:***

***Origin:*** the Centeen’s oral history goes back millennia yet they have only existed on Flax for a handful of generations. They appeared through an arcane portal the scale of which had never been seen before, and has never been seen since. The Centeen claim to be the only remnants of a once great network of tribes that roamed a great plain thousands of miles across. Their nation was besieged by some kind of demon that arrived with iron and flame, they lost battle after battle for a dozen years as their civilization was reduced to ruin. Fearing for the survival of their species the remaining Centeen tribes banded together; their mages lead by the great sorcerer Yiru, now known as Yiru, the sacrifice, worked together, and gave their lives, to summon forth the arcane power used to produce the portal that brought the Centeen to Flax.
