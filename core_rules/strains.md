# Strains

### Basics:
Strains are the intelligent species of Flax that, generally, consider themselves persons. Not all strains are treated equally in all societies or by each other. The strains listed as primary strains can be found in all nations of Flax and, generally, recognize each other as persons, while those listed as secondary are either less common, considered inferior by other strains, or both. Each strain has a series of stats as described below:
* ***Physical Appearance -*** a brief physical description of the strain.
* ***Origin -*** many strains trace their origins back to the Ohma who created them.
* ***Size -*** the starting size attribute (before traits) for members of this strain.
* ***Base Attributes -*** the starting value of each of the four primary attributes before they are increased during character creation.
* ***Attribute points -*** the number of points members of this strain have to spend on increasing their attributes during character creation. Increasing a base attribute by one point cost one attribute point providing that attribute has a score of less than twice its base value; once an attribute's value is double its base value it costs two attribute points to increase further.
* ***Required Traits -*** these are traits, that may or may not be available to other strains, that every member of the strain possesses.
* ***Strain Traits -*** some strains have access to, but are not required to take, certain traits that are not available to everyone; they, if available, will be listed here.
* ***Arcane Traits -*** not all strains have access to every arcane trait; the arcane traits available to the strain, along with their cost will be listed here.
* ***Trait Points -*** not all strains are equally powerful, to balance this out during character creation they will apply this modifier to how many Trait Points they have to use during character creation. If the modifier would reduce the total number of available Trait Points to below 10 it is suggested that the strain not be used at that power level for a PC.

### Primary strains:

#### Centeen
So similar to Sapeen that, but for their dusky skin, they would be mistaken for them; they are in fact so similar that they are capable of interbreeding though the offspring produced of these cross strain unions are always mules.

***Physical Appearance:*** Centeen have dusky skin and tightly curled sandy to dark brown hair atop their heads, though they sport little body or facial hair. Females average five and a half feet with males being slightly taller and broader. Most Centeen have green or hazel eyes, though blue and orange are not unheard of, and many have faces dotted with tiny freckles.

***Origin:*** The Centeen’s oral history goes back millennia yet they have only existed on Flax for a handful of generations. They appeared through an arcane portal the scale of which had never been seen before, and has never been seen since. The Centeen claim to be the only remnants of a once great network of tribes that roamed a great plain thousands of miles across. Their nation was besieged by some kind of demon that arrived with iron and flame, they lost battle after battle for a dozen years as their civilization was reduced to ruin. Fearing for the survival of their species the remaining Centeen tribes banded together; their mages lead by the great sorcerer Yiru, known as The Sacrifice, worked together, and gave their lives, to summon forth the arcane power used to produce the portal that brought the Centeen to Flax.

#### Denja
Denja are generally quick witted and conversational, preferring to participate in battles of the mind rather than battles of the sword.  Most people find it hard to dislike a Denja once they become acquainted; it is rare indeed for a lord not to have at least one in his employment to aid in mediation.  When encountered outside of a town or city Denja rarely travel alone, in part because they get lonely easily, and in part because they make easy targets for bandits and highwaymen.

***Physical Appearance:*** Denja are short and reptilian in appearance.  Rarely growing over four feet tall Denja are covered with small flexible scales that are usually green or blue in color with red and brown being less common, albinos also exist though they seem to only be born in the Bredth Bogs. Denja have three fingers hands and feet adorn with small claws, their feet but not their hands are webbed. Some Denja possess a thin skin flap that can fill the space in between their arms and legs; the skin displays a pair of vibrant eye patterns, but it can also serve as a method of transportation if a Denja launches themselves from a tall platform or tree.

***Origin:*** Denja are amongst the elder strains having been created by The Wood Mistress, Eightoo, in The First Days. They were created alongside the Garjins of the bogs and still consider those behemoths family. The Denja were the first of the strains to leave their ancestral homelands and be found by the Mablen; together they created the first set of laws and the origins of what became the common tongue.

#### Kaazt
Born to be fierce and competitive tribal warriors Kaazt are truly of two breeds, those who were raised in the Great Jungles and those who were not. Kaazt who grew up as part of the ancient packs that dwell in the oldest jungles are generally xenophobic and hostile to members of other strains; they are considered quite primitive by their more civilized brethren. It has been millennia, however, sense Kaazt first migrated out of the Jungles, in this time they have traveled to all parts of the Great Continent and have found homes in nearly every nation. Kaazt are generally quite friendly with those whom they consider friends but most are somewhat reclusive and uncomfortable around those they do not know.

***Physical Appearance:*** These semi-bipedal felines stand between four and a half and five and a half feet tall are lightly built and covered with fur. A Kaazt’s fur can come in many colors and patterns with the length and thickness increasing, for males, around the head and shoulders. Kaazt sport five phalanges on their hands and feet, each one, save the thumb, ending in a razor sharp, retractable, claw that Kaazt use for climbing or combat.

***Origin:*** The youngest of the strains, Kaazt were created by the Vine Queen, Ancon. Ancon was fearful that her great jungles would be invaded by the various strains wondering the face of Flax and, as the last act of The Second Days, breathed life into the Kaazt tasking them to protect her domain from invaders.

#### Rhosk
Originally natives to the Northern Desert, and though many have migrated south these are the two things that all Rhosk are skilled at: order and war. Rhosk in the north are usually associated with Shiver’s defenses in some capacity those found further south often feel a fealty to the north even when not actively working towards its defense. Rhosk are known to be serious and stoic, though dangerous once angered they often find themselves respected despite their lack of close personal friends. Rhosk rarely possess a sense of humor or irony and are falsely rumored to be unable to smile or laugh. Their stoicism and natural understanding of tactics makes Rhosk natural field commanders for any nations military.

***Physical Appearance:*** Ranging from seven to eight feet in height Rhosk look down on most other Strains, they stand straight and have broad shoulders and long arms. Their bodies are covered with down except for their shoulders and spine which sport much longer and darker, shaggy looking, feathers. Rhosk have slightly flat faces that tend to be lighter in color than their body feathers, which range in color from a deep brown to a russet to a pale light blue; their heads are crowned with tall, slightly pointed, ears that resemble those of a wolf.  

***Origin:*** Numbering amongst the younger strains of Flax the first Rhosk were carved from great blocks of ice by Shiver, the Northern Wind. Shiver created the Rhosk for the single purpose of guarding her domain from being settled or warred upon by the older strains; she taught them the secrets of stone and ice and as such the Rhosk became the first great builders on Flax.

#### Sapeen
Most often found living in towns and cities or on lands ruled by one Sapeen are one of the most prevalent strains on flax, can be found in any civilized area and are the most common single strain in most nations. Sapeen are amongst the most ambitious and adaptive of the strains, they are as eager to learn new sciences and trades as they are eager to expand the lands of their mother nation.

***Physical Appearance:*** Sapeen are bipedal, mostly hairless, creatures that range from five to six feet in height. Their skin is generally a tan or pink color with some families skin tone reaching almost a milk white. Sapeen hair ranges in color from black to white and brown to yellow to orange.

***Origin:*** The eldest of the strains created in the Second Days, Sapeen were created by Clursus, the Cleanser, who recognized the limitations of the elder strains and wished to create a more adaptive species rule on Flax. With the help of the Mablen Sapeen developed tribal societies that quickly spread to all inhabited corners of Flax.

#### Teejee(male)
The most diverse of strains Teejee females are either breeders or drones; the breeders tend to be largely sedentary commanding their drones and male children to carry out their will while drones, though technically members of a strain, are only slightly more intelligent than a dog. Male Teejee, however, are both intelligent and personable.

***Physical Appearance:*** Male Teejee are four legged, two armed, insectoids that stand around five feet tall. They are dark grey in color with round heads and faces that sport large eyes, no nose, and round mouths with short, pincer like, mandibles to either side. They are covered with small black and brown hairs all over their bodies. Their three fingered hands are excellent at grasping and manipulating objects but their feet are toeless and largely oval.

***Origin:*** Youngest of the Ancient strains the Teejee had not one but three creators: Tern, the soil, Free, the Jokester, and Free's Sibling, Bodeen, the Laborer. They are the only strain to spend most of their time under ground and had already created massive subterranean complexes by the time the younger strains were taking their first steps on Flax.

#### Torleni
Technically a sub-strain of their Pure-Blooded cousins the Torleni that carry the blood of Shimmer in their veins are so much more common a sight throughout Flax it is not uncommon for the less educated not to know this. Teejee can be found in all the lands that once belonged to the Kingdom of Grail that they ruled and still possess most of the positions of power in the lands that once belonged to that, no fractured, kingdom.

***Physical Appearance:***
Two arms, two legs, and covered in scales is about the extent of how you can generalize a Torleni for the blood of Shimmer flows in their veins and they may alter their appearances individually to their will. Each Torleni shapes themselves as they see fit, gaining or loosing mass, growing claws or wings, spitting acid or fire, changing the color and pattern of their scales, and even the shape of their faces and sound of their voice. Torleni are truly the most diverse of strains in appearances.

***Origin:***
Torleni were created by Milnot, the mistress of the mountain, in the range dominated by Mount Milomb. In the first days Milnot was not the only Ohma to dwell amongst her children however; Shimmer, the changeling, unable to create a strain of his own, resided with the Torleni and mixed his blood with theirs until nearly all of Milnot's children were decedents of Shimmer as well. Some say that Shimmer still resides on Mount Milomb teaching and guiding the Torleni who reside in their ancestral birthplace.
