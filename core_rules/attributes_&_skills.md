# Attributes & Skills

### Primary Attributes:
Character’s have four primary attributes that describe their physical and mental talent. Primary attributes play a key role in determining a character’s potential for success in various actions.
* Body - a character’s strength, stamina, and toughness.
* Reflexes - how quickly a character moves or reacts.
* Perception - how well tuned the character’s senses are.
* Mind - a character’s learning and mental discipline.

### Secondary Attributes:
These statistics and resources are derived from the character’s strain, primary attributes, and skills.
* Size - determined by a character’s strain and traits.
* Reach - equal to the character’s size.
* Melee defense bonus - added to a character’s defense against melee attacks they are aware of. This bonus is equal to a character’s ranks in melee combat and the parry/block secondary skill.
* Ranged defense bonus - added to a character’s defense against ranged attacks they are aware of. This bonus is equal to a character’s rank in the dodge secondary skill.
* Max. Wounds - a character with this many wounds will soon die without medical attention. Max wounds is equal to 4 + the character’s body stat.
* Movement - equal to 3 + the character’s size + their ranks in personal movement.
##### Resources:
These attributes can be depleted, the maximum amount of the resource a character can have is the listed stat.
* Defense - a measure of how hard a character is to hit. A character’s defense is equal to 7 + reflexes + perception + twice their rank in personal defense - their size.
* Stamina - a measure of how much energy a character has. A character’s stamina is equal to 10 + body + ranks in Endurance + ranks in the stamina secondary skill.
* Initiative (optional) - a measure of how quickly the character acts. Initiative is equal to the sum of a character’s current defense and current stamina.

* Agility: a measure of a character’s balance and flexibility, this skill should be used when a character is performing acrobatics, body contortion, keep one’s balance, or tumbling.
* Alertness/Awareness: this general perceptual skill relates to noticing things, it should be used for any notice based skill checks.
* Animal Handling: how familiar is the character with animals, particularly domestic ones. This skill should be used when dealing with an animal that has a chance of being controlled or calmed.
* Craft/Profession/Trade: Not one skill but a collection of them that few character’s are likely to have more than one of. A basic skill should be a broad grouping and should have at least three options for secondary skills. Some examples include - Smith (Black, White, Weapon, Armor), Woodworker (Bower, Furniture maker, Whittler, Carpenter), Architect (Houses, Walls, Steeples, Towers, Bridges), Mason (Stoneworker, Bricklayer, Stonecutter, Road Worker), Artist (Sculptor, Painter, Drafter), Cook (Chef, Army cooking, Limited ingredients), Thief (Pick pockets, Cut purse, Pick lock), Performer (Orator, Actor, Singer), Musician (Lute, Flute, Harp, Violin, Composer), Alchemy (Poisons, Medicine, Arcane Essence)
* Discipline/Willpower: a measure of a character’s self control and ability to resist fear and mental fatigue. This skill should be used when a character has to act against his base desire or when otherwise compelled to do something he’s trying not to.
* Endurance: a measure of a character’s resistance to exhaustion and the elements. The skill should be used when a character is avoiding or resisting an effect such as fatigue or poison as well as when recovering from injury or illness.
* Knowledge/Scholar: formal education is rare but for families powerful or wealthy enough to afford it there are many fields of study. This skill is for determining if a character knows something that is not common knowledge.
* Languages: how well versed a character is in various spoken and written languages. Each language has a difficulty, which is reduced by the character’s basic skill ranks plus twice their secondary skill(s) ranks; language groups contribute half of their total ranks to each language in their group towards fluency. A character is fluent in a language when it's reduced to zero difficulty.
* Magical Aptitude: how attuned and well trained at magic a character is. Characters with an arcane trait will use this skill for crafting magical effects and casting spells, non mages use this skill only for magic theory and explanation.
* Medical: how skilled a character is in the healing arts. Medical is used whenever practicing healing.
* Melee Combat: how well a character fights with a sword, axe, or fists. Melee combat skill is most often used when fighting in close quarters but does have a place in many sporting activities as well.
* Personal Defense: how apt a character is at avoiding getting hit or keeping themselves from harm. This skill affects the character’s defense.
* Personal Movement: a character’s speed and competency during their natural movements. Used whenever a character’s speed and footing comes into question.
* Ranged combat: many characters have need to hit a target from a distance for combat or hunting. This skill should be rolled on all attack rolls related to a fired, loosed, or thrown weapon.
* Stealth/Obfuscate: how well a character conceals themselves or something/someone else as well as how well they may disguise themselves or move in such a way as to avoid notice. This skill should be used when hiding, stealth, or disguise is involved.
* Survival: how well a character can keep themselves alive and healthy outside of civilization or when in the less comfortable parts of it. This skill should be rolled when a character is trying to keep themselves comfortable, fed, or otherwise taken care of when conditions are not conducive to it.
