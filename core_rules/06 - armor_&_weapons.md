# Armor & Weapons

## Armor:
Characters expecting combat tend to make sure they are as well protected as they can afford to be.

#### Armor Statistics:
Values that detail how the armor protects its wearer.
* Armor value: used to determine if penetrating damage is blocked and becomes concussive.
* Body value: added to the character’s body stat when determining how much damage is taken from a blow.
* Reflex value: a number of penalty dice reduced by the sum of the character’s rank in personal defense and the armor secondary skill added to all reflex based skill checks performed with the penalized body location.
* Damage reduction: types and amount by which damage the character would suffer is reduced.
* Body locations: location(s) covered by the armor.

#### Layered armor:
When a character is wearing multiple layers of armor they gain cumulative benefits from each layer as follows:
* Armor value - the total armor value a character gets is equal to the highest armor value of all the layers they are wearing plus one for each additional layer that has an armor value above zero.
* Body value - the total body value a character gets is equal to the highest body value of all the layers they are wearing plus half, rounded down, the value of each other layer.
* Reflex value - the sum of the values of each piece of armor plus one for each layer beyond the first.
* Damage reduction - while damage reduction does not stack the character wearing multiple layers of armor may use the highest value of each type of damage reduction from amongst all layers.

## Weapons:
Weapons come in two basic types, melee and ranged, with some throwing weapons have statistics for both.

#### Melee weapon statistics:
Values that apply to the weapon being used.
* Reach: the default reach of the weapon.
* Difficulty: attack skill checks made with the weapon receive this many penalty dice reduced by the sum of the character’s ranks in melee combat and the weapon’s secondary skill.
* Parry bonus: listed in three parts, one handed, two handed, and off handed; add this bonus to the character’s melee defense when wielding the weapon in these ways. A character’s total parry bonus can not exceed the sum of their ranks in personal defense, the parry secondary skill, and the weapon’s secondary skill(s). Reduce this bonus by one for each penalty die the character would gain due to the weapon’s difficulty.
* Cover bonus: a defensive bonus that only applies to attacks originating in the character’s front arc, shields gain additional cover bonus equal to the character's rank in the shields secondary skill.
* Secondary skill: the specific secondary skill(s) related to the use of this weapon.
* Notes: any additional information needed for the proper use of the weapon including any brawling or ranged attacks that can be made with it.
* Attacks: each weapon will have one or more attacks that it can perform.


#### Melee weapon attack statistics:
* Damage Type: what type of damage this attack deals, either piercing (P) or concussive (C).
* APV: the armor piercing value of this attack.
* Damage: how much damage this attack deals.
* Additional Success Uses: one or more advantages that can be gained by spending additional success rolled on this attack's skill check.
* Notes: any additional notes related to this attack.

#### Ranged weapon statistics:
* Body: the body stat of the weapon. This relates to usage penalties for bows, and reloading for crossbows. Thrown weapons have a body stat equal to the character's.
* Close Range: the maximum distance this weapon can be used at without suffering a range penalty.
* Range Increment: a range used to determine how many times the range penalty is applied. Take the range to the target, subtract weapon's close range and, if the total is currently greater than zero, divide by the weapon's range increment; the result, rounded up, is the number of times the range penalty will be applied to the attack.  
* Max Range: the max range the weapon can hit a target at.
* Range Penalty: listed as dice, damage, and APV. Dice is the number of penalty dice added to the attack's skill check, damage and APV is the amount by which those attributes are lowered for this attack. This penalty will be applied a number of times, based on the weapon's range increment, for all attacks made beyond close range.
* Damage Type: what type of damage this attack deals, either piercing (P) or concussive (C).
* Damage: the base amount of damage this weapon deals, often listed as X + ammo die; this means the damage is a flat amount modified by some number or variable based on the ammo used.
* APV: the base APV of this weapon's attacks, often listed as X + ammo die; this means the damage is a flat amount modified by some number or variable based on the ammo used.
* Additional Success Uses: one or more advantages that can be gained by spending additional success rolled on this attack's skill check.
* Notes: any additional notes related to this attack.
